OF CLIFFWOOD</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br>

<small>OUT WITH THE BOYS ON HALLOWE’EN</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">How’s</span> that, fellows?”</p>

<p>“Everything’s lovely, and the <i>gate</i> hangs high,
not the goose!”</p>

<p>“Mr. Philpot is going to have some climb, believe
me, before he gets it down out of that big
oak, as sure as my name’s Dan Fenwick!”</p>

<p>“And say, wouldn’t you like to see Farmer
Hasty in the morning when he rubs his eyes and
stares up at his wagon, all taken apart, and strung
along the ridge-pole of his barn roof?”</p>

<p>“That was a cracking good idea of yours, Dick,
and no mistake!”</p>

<p>“Hurrah for Hallowe’en, and all its fun!”</p>

<p>“What’s next on the programme, boys? We’re
out for a good time tonight, you know.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t much after eleven at that. Who’s got
another clever joke laid out?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>“I have; and when you hear what the game is
you’ll all say it’s the boss scheme of the lot, barring
none.”</p>

<p>“Listen to Nat, will you? I wondered why he
was lugging that bundle around with him all the
evening. I guess it’s got something to do with
his grand Hallowe’en prank.”</p>

<p>“It has, and a whole lot, Peg Fosdick,” proudly
admitted the boy upon whom all eyes were eagerly
centered just then.</p>

<p>“Who’s the victim, Nat?” demanded one fellow,
the same who had owned to the name of Dan
Fenwick.</p>

<p>“Who but that crusty old storekeeper, Jed
Nocker,” said the big, overgrown boy with a
chuckle of delight. “Everybody else seems to have
just gone and clean forgotten all about <i>him</i> tonight.”</p>

<p>At mention of this name all sorts of groans and
catcalls arose from the group of seven lads standing
on a corner in a quiet, residential part of the
usually bustling mill town of Cliffwood.</p>

<p>“The meanest old codger in our town!” exclaimed
one fellow, in sheer disgust.</p>

<p>“And he hates all boys worse than he does
snakes!”</p>

<p>“Cuffed my ears more’n once, let me tell you,
for some little thing I did in meeting.”</p>

<p>“Oh! my mother says Deacon Nocker believes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
every boy is as chock full of original sin as an egg
is of meat; and that the only way to get it out is
to keep on whaling the boy.”</p>

<p>“His pet saying is ‘spare the rod and spoil the
child,’ I’ve heard people say.”</p>

<p>“Huh! all the same that kind of tactics didn’t
keep the Deacon’s only boy from being wild,”
chuckled Dan Fenwick, wickedly, as though it gave
him considerable pleasure to remember that in
this particular case guidance didn’t begin at home.</p>

<p>“Oh! they say Amos always was a bad egg, and
that the old deacon wrestled with him day after
day. Then something came up, and Amos ran
away. The deacon scratched his name off his
books, and refused to send along a dollar, even
when he heard Amos was married, and had a little
boy of his own.”</p>

<p>“Well, it was an oversight for us to let Jed
Nocker off this Hallowe’en, when we always had
him on our list,” admitted the boy the others had
called Dick, and who, despite the fact that his
clothes looked well worn, seemed to be something
of a leader among his mates.</p>

<p>“Then you agree to listen to my big scheme for
giving him the scare of his life, do you, Dick
Horner?” demanded Nat, eagerly.</p>

<p>He very well knew that once Dick had stamped
the idea O. K. the others would hasten to follow
suit, because they had great faith in Dick’s ability<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
as a pilot, whether in baseball, on the gridiron,
or in such rough-and-tumble sports as all town boys
pursue so strenuously.</p>

<p>“I want to hear it first,” replied Dick, cautiously,
showing that he had a streak of discretion
in his nature for all he was such a madcap. “Suppose
we adjourn to the sand lot up the street. It’s
more retired than this corner, and we can talk it
over without any one running across us.”</p>

<p>“A bright idea, Dick!” exclaimed another boy
who had not as yet broken into the conversation.
Leslie Capes was known as a fellow of few words,
preferring to listen until he had mastered all the
points of a discussion before giving his particular
views.</p>

<p>“Come along then, fellows,” urged the big,
broad-shouldered Nat, eagerly, leading the way
along the street; “and ten to one you’ll say my
scheme is just the boss way to pay old Nocker back
for all he’s done to the boys of Cliffwood.”</p>

<p>While they are hurrying along toward the open
sand lot spoken of, a few explanations regarding
the fun-loving lads may not come in amiss, since
these boys and others of the rising generation of
Cliffwood are destined to figure largely in our
story.</p>

<p>Dick Horner was a clever young chap, though
inclined to be headstrong and wild. He lived in
an humble cottage home with his little sister Sue,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
his mother, a widow, and old “Grandpop” Horner,
a Civil War veteran, who had long been a
striking figure in Cliffwood. The old soldier with
his white locks down almost to his shoulders lived
pretty much in the days of the dead and gone past,
and could rarely talk without bringing up the times
when he had fought so well.</p>

<p>Pretty much all the Horners had to live upon
consisted of the pension a generous government
paid the veteran yearly in installments, and a small
yearly sum from a meager investment in some industrial
stocks, so that Dick seldom saw anything
like new clothes unless he earned the money himself.</p>

<p>Dan Fenwick and Leslie Capes were Dick’s two
most intimate chums. The former was as full of
the spirit of mischief as Dick himself, but when it
came down to a question of leadership, both of
them readily yielded the palm to Dick, whose will
seemed to bend theirs.</p>

<p>Leslie’s folks were comfortably well off. In
addition to this there was an old indulgent uncle
living with them, who could be prevailed upon to
keep Leslie well supplied with funds, though the
money always came accompanied with good advice.
Uncle Henry believed in boys.</p>

<p>Peg Fosdick had once broken his leg, and ever
since had walked with a slight limp. At home
and in school he was called Oscar, but the temptation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
to dub him “Peg” had proved so strong that
long ago he had yielded to the inclination of his
companions and readily answered to that nickname.</p>

<p>The other boys were Andy Hale and Elmer
Jones, both of them just ordinary chaps without
any remarkable traits of character. Both were
good-natured fellows, ready for fun, or even a little
row for a change, the type of boy you can always
run across by the dozen in any American
town.</p>

<p>Cliffwood was something of a manufacturing
town, by virtue of the output of several mills that
depended on the water power yielded by the little
Sweetwater River. Half a mile above the town
lay the rapids, with a fall of some fifteen feet or
more. This natural advantage in power had
caused the erection of the big Bartlett Paper Mills,
and several other manufacturing establishments.</p>

<p>Cliffwood, on this account, had more than its
share of workers, who, as a rule, received fair
wages, and were seemingly contented.</p>

<p>Dick Horner looked forward to the time when
he would be big enough to start to work and earn
enough money to supply his dear mother with more
of the comforts of life. He hated to be so poor,
and this desire to do something for his mother was
really one of the best things in the boy’s nature.</p>

<p>Dick did not have so bad a reputation in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
town as the big bully, Nat Silmore, but all the same
the stories that drifted to the ears of his anxious
mother often caused her gentle heart pain. Dick,
upon being appealed to, always promised to turn
over a new leaf, and then in the end his natural
overflow of wild spirits led him into some new
mischief, for which in turn he would be sorry.</p>

<p>The vacant lot which Dick had in view was not
far distant, so the seven boys out for Hallowe’en
sport soon arrived there. Eager to hear what Nat
had to say, the others clustered around the big fellow.
As a rule the others rather preferred Nat’s
room to his company.</p>

<p>“Here we are waiting for you to give us the
particulars of your grand stunt, Nat,” remarked
Dan, impatiently tugging at the other’s sleeve.</p>

<p>“Yes,” added Peg, “and the sooner you open up
the quicker we can get busy; that is, of course, if
we think it’s a good idea.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I ain’t worrying myself about you backing
out,” said Nat, with fine scorn. “I’ve done
some big things in my time, and if I do say it myself
this takes the cake for boldness. We’ll pay
the crusty old skinflint back for all the snappy
things he’s done to the boys of Cliffwood.”</p>

<p>“Get busy, Nat,” said Dick, shortly.</p>

<p>Somehow these few words seemed to have more
effect on Nat than all the urging of the other fellows.
He knew Dick could veto the scheme if he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
felt inclined, and since his own cronies were debarred
from keeping him company on this one
wild night of the year, by reason of sickness, and
absence from town, Nat had to depend on Dick’s
crowd for assistance in carrying out his plan.</p>

<p>“All right, Dick, here goes then,” he hastened
to say, as he started to unwrap the bundle he had
been carrying around with him. “You can see just
what I’ve toted along so as to be ready for business
when the right time came.”</p>

<p>“Why, it looks like a small drygoods store, I
declare!” exclaimed Peg.</p>

<p>“Old sheets, fellows,” announced Nat, triumphantly.
“D’ye know what they can be used for?
Any of you ever play <i>ghost</i> in your lives? Well, I
have, and a sheet is always needed in the game.”</p>

<p>“Go on and tell us what you aim to do with the
old sheets, Nat!” urged Andy.</p>

<p>“Just this,” then replied the other eagerly.
“We can creep through the grounds of the empty
Brandon place that lies next door to Jed’s property.
We’ll find some way to get inside his house,
and just when the town clock is striking midnight,
we’ll start to groaning to beat the band, and show
up before the old chap. Dick here, who can throw
his voice so well, will do the talking, and tell him
we’ve come from the land of spirits to take him
back with us. There, what d’ye think of my
scheme, fellows? Ain’t it a dandy?”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>

<small>A SCHEME THAT WENT WRONG</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a brief interval after Nat had so triumphantly
announced his grand scheme for frightening
Old Deacon Nocker the other boys were still. Apparently,
every one was digesting the idea, and
coming to some sort of a mental decision. Dan
Fenwick was the first to voice his views.</p>

<p>“It strikes me as a cracking good prank, Nat!”
he exclaimed, “and I’m voting to help you carry
the same out.”</p>

<p>“Count me in for one of your old sheets, Nat!”
cried Peg, enthusiastically.</p>

<p>“Dick, what do you say?” asked Leslie Capes,
a little anxiously, as though he rather hoped the
other would veto the whole business by declaring
it was too silly, or too full of danger.</p>

<p>If this was Leslie’s expectation, he was doomed
to disappointment, for Dick immediately came out
with a full endorsement of Nat’s proposal.</p>

<p>“I go you, Nat,” he said, presently; “the scheme
is worth trying out. Of course, if any fellow
chooses to stand back and miss the fun, he’s at liberty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
to do it; but I’ll borrow one of your old
sheets; and I’ll do my level best to throw my voice
so as to make it sound like it came up from the
grave.”</p>

<p>“Then we’re all in on the game, if you say so,
Dick,” declared Andy Hale.</p>

<p>“Ditto here!” echoed Elmer, feeling that the
die was now cast; and no one had ever called him
a quitter.</p>

<p>“How about you, Leslie?” asked Nat, sneeringly,
for he had noticed that the other seemed uneasy
when the great scheme was first broached.</p>

<p>“Who, me?” replied the Capes boy, scornfully.
“Did any one ever know me to back down when
my chums were in for a lark? I speak for another
of the sheets, Nat.”</p>

<p>“There, the clock struck the half hour,” interrupted
Dick, “and if we want to be on deck at
exactly midnight, we’d better get a hustle on.”</p>

<p>“Come along fellows, we’ll chase out along the
road here to the Brandon place, and climb the
fence there. Say, I prowled around today and
got my bearings all right.”</p>

<p>It was not a great distance to the vacant Brandon
place, and the seven mischief-loving boys
scrambled over the old fence with the greatest of
ease. Nat did not seem really to need any lantern
to show him the way, so well had he stamped the
lay of the grounds on his memory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>Arriving at the dividing fence he showed the
others where he had taken pains to pull off some
boards, allowing a free passage to the adjoining
grounds of the rich old storekeeper, who seemed
to have such a poor opinion of all boys after his
complete failure to bring his own son up by strict
methods.</p>

<p>“Look there, I can see lights in his house!”
whispered Elmer.</p>

<p>“Oh! that’s nothing unusual!” declared Dick;
“they say the old man is awake all hours of the
night, making up his accounts and reading. He
puts on a bold front, but I reckon when he heard
that his boy died away out West it hit him harder
than he’ll ever own up.”</p>

<p>“Still he’s as hard as nails,” grunted Dan. “My
folks say he had a letter from the girl his son Amos
married, telling him that she and her little boy
were awful poor; and the old skinflint had the
nerve to get Lawyer Bodgkin here to write that if
she sent the kid on he’d agree to stand for his
education, but that he’d never set eyes on the woman
who’d married Amos, thinking she’d fall into
all the old man’s money.”</p>

<p>“But she never did send the child, you notice,”
said Leslie. “Which proves that she cared more
for him than Old Jed’s miser gold.”</p>

<p>“Stop jabbering there, you fellers,” muttered
Nat, with a touch of his ordinary bullying authority,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
for he was used to lording it over Dit Hennesy
and several other boys.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Dick went on to say, “let’s creep up close
to the house, and find out if we can get in through
some window he’s forgotten to fasten. Quiet now,
everybody.”</p>

<p>They wriggled their way through the new leafless
undergrowth with considerable skill, and soon
reached the side of the large building. Then a
hasty search was made, which resulted in the discovery
that one window fastening had been overlooked
by Old Jed when going his rounds earlier
in the evening.</p>

<p>Dick soon had the window raised without making
any noise. Perhaps the hearts of several of
those boys beat faster than customary as they
crawled in through the aperture. They knew they
were doing something that bordered on the lawless,
for to break in and enter a house, even in
pursuit of Hallowe’en fun, was an act that no
court would sanction or forgive, no matter how
lenient the judge might be.</p>

<p>What made it seem more realistic was the fact
that Nat had come prepared to show them the way,
for he carried a small electric flashlight, which, by
constantly keeping in action, he could use to advantage.</p>

<p>“Whee! this makes me feel queer,” whispered
Andy in the ear of Elmer, as they started to pick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
their way across the room, avoiding such obstacles
as chairs and tables.</p>

<p>“Wonder if this is the way a burglar always
feels,” the other answered, in such a low tone that
it could not have been heard three feet away.</p>

<p>Dick turned on them, and shook his head as if
to intimate that even such communications were
out of order. Then he started to get his sheet
fixed, Nat having previously torn places in each
covering so that they could be used for peep holes.</p>

<p>By the time four of them had rigged themselves
out in these ridiculous costumes, the parlor of Deacon
Nocker’s big house looked as though it might
be the assembling place for the whole ghost tribe.</p>

<p>After glancing about to make sure all was ready,
Nat gave Dick the signal agreed upon. From that
time forward he wanted Dick to take the lead,
since it was up to the other to do what speaking
was required.</p>

<p>They could see that there was a light in the library,
for a line under the connecting door betrayed
this fact. The window being open, every
one plainly heard the not far-distant town clock
begin to strike the witching hour of midnight.</p>

<p>Hardly had the last solemn clang died away
when a deep groan arose, Dick being the one to
start the ball rolling. He waited to ascertain what
the effect might be before repeating the performance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>Evidently, Deacon Nocker had heard the groan,
for they caught the sound of his chair falling over
in his haste to jump to his feet. The question now
was whether he would be afraid to look in on them
as they hoped. But all doubt on that score was
quickly dissipated, for the old man suddenly threw
the door wide open, and then started back at sight
of what he saw beyond.</p>

<p>The four who were covered with the sheets all
pointed straight at the owner of the house, just
as they had read supposed-to-be ghosts always did.
Elmer, Dan and Andy, not possessing any ghostly
apparel, had hidden themselves behind sundry articles
of bulky furniture, whence they peered
out as best they might in the endeavor to see all
the “fun.”</p>

<p>At first sight it appeared as though Deacon
Nocker was a badly frightened man, especially
when a mysterious and solemn voice sounding very
creepy, and coming from overhead, was heard.</p>

<p>“Be warned, rash mortal,” it said. “We have
come from the land of spirits to tell you to mend
your ways before it is too late. Love your neighbors,
and do good. If they smite you on one cheek
turn the other. Help the poor and needy when the
cold winds of winter begin to blow. Your time
on earth is short, and you will have no other
chance. Listen, ponder, and act!”</p>

<p>Considering that Dick had such a short time in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
which to think up what he ought to say when pointing
his hand at the old deacon this was not so bad.
Some of his companions considered it highly entertaining;
indeed, Elmer, or was it Andy, safe in
his place of concealment, even ventured to chuckle.
This sound may have given the alarmed old man
the first suspicion that his ghostly visitors were
something more than they seemed to be in that
half-darkened room.</p>

<p>They heard him utter a snarl. Then he reached
in with one hand, there was a sudden “click” and
the parlor was flooded with light, for the deacon
had turned the electric switch!</p>

<p>Of course in that dazzling glow the nature of
the precious “fake” was readily exposed. The
boys saw the deacon stare angrily at them, and
then whirling around rush back into his library as
though for something with which to assail these
unbidden guests.</p>

<p>“Cut for it, fellows; he’s gone for his gun!”
exclaimed Nat, excitedly, at the same moment
throwing his sheet aside and heading directly for
the open window, through which he plunged headlong.</p>

<p>The others, seized with a panic after the collapse
of Nat’s grand scheme, also jumped for the
only exit. Some went through about as speedily as
Nat had done, while others attempted climbing
down a little more carefully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>By great good luck every one managed to get
outside the house before Old Jed appeared in the
open window of the lighted parlor, carrying a
rusty double-barrel shotgun in his hands. He was
very angry it seemed, because of the fright to
which he had been subjected, for without hesitation,
he fired both barrels of his weapon, though
aiming a bit high.</p>

<p>Seven panic-stricken boys plunged through a wilderness
of bushes, colliding with sundry trees
which they failed to notice, and reaching the fence
by the road at various angles. Here there were
exhibited all sorts of speedy “high and lofty vaulting,”
as the circus posters term it, some of the
fellows even landing on all fours in the dust of
the road.</p>

<p>A short time afterwards a number of them collected
on the sand lot to compare experiences.
Several were nursing bumps they had received
from a too close and intimate acquaintance with
the trees in Deacon Nocker’s front yard. Dan
was holding his handkerchief to his nose, and the
sanguinary hue of the aforementioned article
would indicate that he had come to grief in his
mad flight.</p>

<p>Still they would not have been real boys if they
had not seen the humorous side of their late adventure.
Even Dan chuckled between dips with
his handkerchief, though Dick made him throw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
his head back, and breathe evenly so as to try to
stop the flow of blood.</p>

<p>“Where’s Nat?” demanded Leslie, half angrily.</p>

<p>“Oh! you won’t see Nat around again,” asserted
Andy, confidently. “I know him too well to expect
that. He’s about home by this time, for his
kind always runs away, to let others shoulder the
blame.”</p>

<p>“What’s bothering me,” admitted Elmer, ruefully,
“is whether Old Jed recognized any of us.
When he flashed that light he must have seen me
staring out at him from behind that sofa.”</p>

<p>“And I’m afraid I dropped my cap somewhere,”
said Dick, uneasily. “The worst thing about it is
I was silly enough to write my name inside.”</p>

<p>“Whew! that may mean a whole lot of trouble
for the crowd, Dick!” exclaimed Leslie. “But
just remember that what happens to one must concern
all. We’re every bit as guilty as you are;
and if Old Jed starts to give you any trouble we’ll
all own up and take the penalty.”</p>

<p>“That’s mighty good of you to say that, Leslie,”
declared Dick. “But perhaps after all the deacon
will remember it was Hallowe’en. He must have
been a boy himself once, and ought to forgive such
pranks. But let’s get home now, fellows, and forget
our troubles. Come on, Dan, if you’re through
shedding your gore. So-long all the rest of you.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

<small>THE MAN WHO HAD FAITH</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Good</span> morning, Mr. Holwell!”</p>

<p>“Glad to see you, Harry. I suppose you are on
your way to the mills, for since you decided to act
as assistant to your good father, instead of going
another two years to college, you’ve been sticking
pretty close to your work.”</p>

<p>Mr. Thomas Holwell, the best-loved pastor in
Cliffwood, shook hands most heartily with the fine
looking young fellow whom he had met on the
main street of the town about eight o’clock in the
morning of that first day of November.</p>

<p>Harry Bartlett was the only son of the head
of the big paper mills. He had always been a
credit to the town, and won many honors for his
school both with regard to scholarships and in athletics.
Two years in college had seen him getting
along famously, when a change in his father’s
health caused him to alter all his plans, bringing
him back home to assume some of the business
cares.</p>

<p>“Oh! I find plenty of time to be doing some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
other things that I care for, in spite of the heavy
work at the mills,” replied young Bartlett, cheerily.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know you are taking a deep interest in
the work at our local Y. M. C. A.,” the older gentleman
went on to say, still gripping Harry’s hand
warmly in his. “It was largely through the benevolence
of your good father that we were able to
hire that building, and establish a home for our
many young men, where they could be kept off
the street nights, and enjoy themselves in clean
sport.”</p>

<p>The boys and young men in Cliffwood had no
better friend in all that region than the Rev.
Thomas Holwell. It had been largely through
his hearty labors that the idea of having a local
Y. M. C. A. finally assumed definite shape, and
leading men of the town had subscribed enough
money to put the project through.</p>

<p>“I fancy the younger element in town must have
been pretty busy last night,” Harry remarked,
partly to change the subject, for he was very modest,
and never liked to hear his own praises sung,
even by the minister whom he loved so well.</p>

<p>“Oh! as to that,” the older gentleman observed,
“we always expect something along the line of innocent
pranks to happen on that one boys’ night
of the year. Wise people take in their doormats
and clothes-poles. Some I know even make it a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
point to hide all gates that are removable, ash barrels,
and such things. We mustn’t forget that we
were boys ourselves once upon a time.”</p>

<p>Harry laughed as though some memories connected
with sundry doings along those same lines
haunted him.</p>

<p>“They seem to be getting bolder every year,
I’m afraid,” he continued. “I was out for a tramp
as a sort of bracer, after daylight this morning,
and wondered what on earth old Farmer Hasty
could be doing up on the roof of his big barn. It
seems some boys had taken one of his wagons all
apart, and fastened the wheels along the ridge-pole.
He was pretty mad about it too.”</p>

<p>Mr. Holwell sighed and shook his head.</p>

<p>“Some of those boys are getting to be pretty
wild, I’m afraid, Harry,” he went on to remark,
reflectively. “They pursue their desire for fun
too far. I’ve been doing more or less hard thinking
lately about them, and mean to have a serious
talk with you soon, to see if something can be done
to lead that love for a frolic in the right channel.”</p>

<p>“Here comes Mr. Nocker, and looking more
severe than I ever knew him to be,” remarked
Harry Bartlett. “I wonder if any of the boys
have been playing practical jokes on the deacon.
I can remember doing that same thing, and once
got a good drenching in the bargain from a bucket
of water at his hands.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>“Good morning, Deacon Nocker,” said Mr.
Holwell, as the richest storekeeper in Cliffwood
reached them. “Harry here was saying you looked
worried this fine morning. I hope you have not
had anything more happen to trouble you?”</p>

<p>The crabbed old man shook his head as he hastened
to reply to this question.</p>

<p>“I’m on my way straight to the office of the
Chief of Police, to swear out warrants against
three boys of this town, who entered my house late
last night, forcing a window just like ordinary
burglars. It’s high time the perverted natures of
our boys were checked. I’ll see to it these three
are put under bonds to behave themselves. I’ve
stood enough, and this outrage is the last straw
that breaks the patient camel’s back.”</p>

<p>“Who are the three lads, Deacon Nocker?”
asked Mr. Holwell, with deep anxiety in his voice,
for he loved all boys, and believed in them.</p>

<p>“I found this cap on my floor after I’d frightened
the lot off, and it’s marked Dick Horner,”
the old man hastened to say, triumphantly flourishing
the head gear as he spoke. “Then I recognized
two other young scamps as Elmer Jones and
Daniel Fenwick. I’m going to have the law on
them for breaking in. The rest of the crowd had
some silly sort of white gowns like sheets on, so I
didn’t see their faces. But the police will find
out who they were, never fear.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>“They must have been trying to play ghost,
thinking to frighten you, Mr. Nocker!” exclaimed
Harry, trying hard to repress the smile he felt
creeping over his face, for possibly he may have
been guilty of some such prank in his younger days.</p>

<p>“No matter what they meant to do,” retorted
the old man, angrily. “It was next door to a crime
to break into a private house as they did. And
trying to frighten any one through such outrageous
means might end in serious results, in case the victim
were afflicted with heart trouble, as I am. I
shall see that Dick Horner and his companions
are made to suffer for their escapade.”</p>

<p>He was about to move on when Mr. Holwell
caught his arm.</p>

<p>“Please wait a minute, Deacon Nocker,” said
the minister, seriously. “You might in your calmer
moments regret having caused the Widow Horner
additional sorrow. We all know she has seen
enough, as it is. If you will listen to my advice
it may not be necessary for you to proceed to such
extreme measures as to cause the arrest of those
good-hearted, but reckless, lads.”</p>

<p>“Boys should be taken in hand and treated severely
if you want them to amount to anything,
Mr. Holwell,” protested the storekeeper, who,
nevertheless, entertained considerable respect for
his pastor, and consequently did not break away
from his gentle, detaining grasp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>“I know that has always been your policy, Deacon,”
said the other. “But some of us believe boys
are more sinned against than sinning. I myself
fancy there is some good in <i>every</i> boy, if only you
can find it. The trouble is we go about it the
wrong way. It is a case of the fierce wind failing
to tear the traveler’s cloak off, when the warm,
genial sunshine soon caused him to shed it.”</p>

<p>“But the Good Book tells us not to refrain from
using the rod,” urged the storekeeper. “I have
heard you read that passage more than a few
times, Mr. Holwell.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but use it in moderation,” explained the
minister, “and then only in love. If I had a boy
of my own I would never whip or punish him for
heedless things he may have done without a heart-to-heart
talk with him afterwards, and a reconciliation.
Harsh actions do not profit one in the case
of boys. I really believe it only serves to make
them think they are being imposed upon, and their
liberties destroyed, which leads to open rebellion.”</p>

<p>“Well, since you ask it as a favor, Mr. Holwell,”
the deacon went on to say, reluctantly, “I
will promise to forego my threat this time. But
it is the last opportunity for those three young
jackanapes. If they ever attempt to bait me again,
I will surely bring them to book, no matter what
ill feeling it causes.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Deacon,” said the minister, shaking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
the old man’s hand, which was put in his rather
reluctantly it must be confessed. “On my part, I
promise you that something is soon going to be
done to curb the reckless habit our boys have of
seeking excitement, and what they call fun. I
think we shall be able to make a considerable difference
in their habits, once we get started.”</p>

<p>At that prophecy the crabbed old man snorted.</p>

<p>“I imagine that will happen, Mr. Holwell,” he
said, sneeringly, “when the heavens fall, or water
starts to run uphill. Kind words never yet controlled
youthful spirits. It’s strap-oil that is
needed to make decent men of them.”</p>

<p>“Ah! yes, but even that stern method often fails,
Deacon,” the minister gently reminded him, and
the old man’s face went whiter than usual, while
speech failed him utterly; for like a stab there
must have come to him the remembrance of the
bright-faced young fellow he had sent away from
home years ago, and whom he never saw again in
life.</p>

<p>He broke away from the hand of the minister,
and muttering to himself, stamped off; but both of
them saw that at least he was now headed for his
store, and not in the direction of police headquarters.</p>

<p>Mr. Holwell and Harry Bartlett stood there
looking after him. The young fellow appeared
somewhat amused, but his companion was very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
grave, and the lines on his forehead told that
serious thoughts were gripping him.</p>

<p>“Things are getting worse all the while, it
seems, Harry,” remarked the minister, finally.
“Our boys are constantly becoming more reckless,
it strikes me, in their desire to have what they call
fun. The times are changing, and we must change
with them. What answered in my younger days
will not fill the bill in these times.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you’re about right there, sir,”
Harry admitted. “Even I can notice that boys are
getting out of hand very fast. They hesitate at
nothing when out for a good time. And I run
across a great many boys loitering on the street
corners as late as ten o’clock at night.”</p>

<p>“Mostly because their homes have not been
made attractive enough for them,” the observant
minister went on to say. “But I’ve tried in vain
to get the co-operation of their parents. Something
else must be done, some way found whereby
we can obtain and hold the interest of these half-grown
lads. And Harry, a brilliant idea flashed
into my mind last night while I sat alone brooding
in my study.”</p>

<p>“I should like to hear what it is, then.”</p>

<p>“First of all I want to tell you, Harry, that I
shall surely need your hearty backing if the plan
I have in view is going to meet with a shadow of
success.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>“Before I hear a word of your scheme, sir, I
can promise you that much,” said the younger
member of the newly reorganized firm of Bartlett
&amp; Company, with hearty emphasis.</p>

<p>“I felt sure I could count on your whole-souled
assistance, Harry!” Mr. Holwell exclaimed, joyously.
“Like myself you believe in boys to the utmost.”</p>

<p>“Then tell me what it is you have been considering,
sir,” urged Harry.</p>

<p>“A radical step in our service for young men
and boys,” said the minister, with flashing eyes,
and enthusiasm beaming from every feature of his
rosy, healthy face. “It is nothing more or less
than to start a junior organization in the Y. M.
C. A., giving younger lads a chance to form a club,
granting them the privileges of the gymnasium, the
reading rooms, and admission to the lecture course
as well. What do you say to that, Harry?”</p>

<p>“A splendid scheme, Mr. Holwell, and I’ll go
into it with all my heart and soul.”</p>

<p>“Come over to the parsonage tonight, then,
Harry, and fetch your father along. I’ll have a
few other people, ladies as well, present, and we’ll
talk over the project; but I tell you now once for
all we must push it through; no halfway measure
will do. Call it eight this evening, Harry. And
here’s wishing great luck to the Boys’ Department
of the Y. M. C. A.!”</p>

<small>SOME WONDERFUL NEWS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Two</span> days after the Hallowe’en episode, Dick
Horner, walking along the main street of Cliffwood,
stopped to look in at the window of the
sporting goods establishment. The display of
guns, fishing tackle, football and hockey requirements,
as well as many games for home and club
entertainment, always possessed a peculiar fascination
for Dick.</p>

<p>He sighed now as he surveyed these tempting
things, for money being always a scarce commodity
at the little Horner cottage, poor Dick could
not afford to squander much on luxuries.</p>

<p>A hearty slap on the back awakened him from
his little day dream. Turning quickly he found
that his chum, Leslie Capes, was standing beside
him, with a broad smile on his face.</p>

<p>“Made up your mind which gun you want, old
fellow?” the newcomer asked, jauntily. “Or perhaps
now it was some of that football stuff you
were mapping out to buy?”</p>

<p>Dick laughed to hide the spasm that shot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
through his heart; for he realized that he needed
a new suit of clothes more than he did any of
those fine articles so temptingly displayed.</p>

<p>“Well, I haven’t decided just yet, Leslie,” he
said, lightly enough, considering what his feelings
had been a moment before. “I’m glad you came
along, for I was just on the point of going over to
your house to see you.”</p>

<p>“I’ll wager a cookey I can guess what your errand
was,” remarked the other.</p>

<p>“Give a try then,” Dick went on to say. “I
don’t believe you’ll come within a thousand yards
of it.”</p>

<p>“Well, this is Friday afternoon, isn’t it, and
we got out early from school,” the other boy
started to explain. “That makes tomorrow Saturday,
and it seems that four of us fellows have a
date to get off with our horse and wagon in the
morning to visit that hickory grove about seven
miles up the Sweetwater, where we’ve heard the
nuts were mighty thick this fall, and plenty still
on the ground.”</p>

<p>Leslie finished with an expectant smile, as
though he really believed he must have struck the
bull’s-eye the first shot. He was surprised to see
Dick shake his head in the negative.</p>

<p>“Better try again,” the other told him.</p>

<p>“Oh! if it’s as deep as all that I’ll have to throw
up the sponge, and own myself beaten,” admitted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
Leslie. “That’s about the only thing I can think
of; unless you’ve got something to tell me about
that Deacon Nocker scrape the other night. Did
he drop over and see your mother, Dick, after
sending your cap to you by one of his store boys?”</p>

<p>“Not a word has been said,” replied Dick, “and
I was beginning to wonder what had come over
Mr. Nocker, because he’s usually so bitter toward
boys. But the mystery has all been made clear
since I met Mr. Holwell, the minister, about half
an hour ago.”</p>

<p>“Did he coax the old deacon to go easy with us,
Dick? It would be just like Mr. Holwell, for
he’s the best friend the boys of Cliffwood ever
had.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it happened that Mr. Holwell and Harry
Bartlett were talking on the morning after Hallowe’en
when they saw the deacon heading for
police headquarters. He told them what had happened,
and how he knew who three of the boys
were who had dared to enter his house at midnight
and tried to give him a terrible fright.”</p>

<p>“Whew! is that a fact, Dick? I can guess what
Mr. Holwell and Harry did then.”</p>

<p>“Yes, they were worried for fear of what the
consequences might be, and finally managed to
talk the deacon into giving up his idea of having
us arrested for trespass and breaking into his
house. Then the two got to talking over matters,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
and the result was a secret meeting held that night
at the parsonage.”</p>

<p>“Why, my Uncle Henry was out that night, and
I couldn’t get him to tell me where he’d been!”
exclaimed Leslie. “He looked mighty mysterious
too, and told me to just hold my horses, and in
good time I might hear something drop.”</p>

<p>“Well,” continued Dick, impressively, “at that
meeting, so Mr. Holwell has just informed me,
for it isn’t going to be kept a secret any longer,
they decided to form a Junior Department of the
Y. M. C. A. so as to keep the younger boys of the
town off the streets nights, by supplying them with
all sorts of entertainments in the headquarters
building of the association.”</p>

<p>Despite the fact that many people were passing
in both directions on that November afternoon,
since they stood on the main street of bustling Cliffwood,
Leslie Capes snatched off his cap and waved
it wildly above his head several times.</p>

<p>“Bully for that!” he exclaimed. “It’s the best
thing that ever happened to Cliffwood since the
day the old town was first started. Oh, I can see
what a big help that’s going to be for all the decent
boys. And in the good old summer time we
can have all sorts of hikes and camping trips. That
is a great surprise you’ve rung in on me, Dick!”</p>

<p>“Hold on!” remarked Dick. “It isn’t only the
decent fellows that are going to have a chance to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
join the club. Mr. Holwell believes in giving
<i>every one</i> a show, even Nat Silmore, Dit Hennesy,
and their crowd. And any of the boys who work
in the mills can be members if they agree to the
rules of the organization.”</p>

<p>“Whew! I wonder how that will work?” said
Leslie, frowning. “I mean about Nat and Dit, for
they’re always such trouble-makers, you know.”</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Holwell is willing to give them all
the chances he can to make good, but you know
that he isn’t going to stand too much nonsense,”
Dick continued. “If Nat starts a racket he’ll find
himself outside the door in a hurry, unless I miss
my guess.”</p>

<p>“We’ll soon be rid of him then,” laughed the
other boy, “because it’s just as natural for Nat
to make himself disagreeable as it is for water to
run down hill. But this is great news you’ve been
telling me, Dick. Queer that I didn’t guess it must
have had some connection with Mr. Holwell, because
he’s always thinking how he can help the
boys along.”</p>

<p>“It’s going to be the beginning of a new era
in Cliffwood, he says,” Dick continued. “He thinks
things are getting pretty near the breaking point,
because for a fact the boys here have been going
it strong of late. I can see that we’ll have jolly
times this winter in that gymnasium and the club
rooms.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>“As like as not Mr. Holwell will get up a whole
lot of entertainments for us, such as moving pictures
of an educational nature,” suggested Leslie.</p>

<p>“He spoke of that,” Dick volunteered, “and
also told me we would have something of our
own to do, though I don’t believe he’s made up his
mind yet what it will be. But once I heard him tell
my mother that years ago he used to belong to a
traveling minstrel show, and had gone through a
pack of interesting adventures while on the road.
So it maybe something along that order.”</p>

<p>“That would be simply immense!” exclaimed
the delighted Leslie. “And they could make you
an end man, Dick. With that ventriloquist voice
of yours I can see how you’d bring down the
house.”</p>

<p>“We won’t cross any bridges till we come to
them,” laughed Dick. “I’m willing to do my part,
no matter where they put me. You see, Mr. Holwell
had a little talk with me about a whole lot
of things, and I sort of made him a promise—never
mind what it was about.”</p>

<p>Leslie looked at his chum seriously and then
went on to say:</p>

<p>“Mebbe I can give a pretty good guess what he
said, Dick; but some other time you may take a
notion to tell me. Mr. Holwell is a fine man, and
if anybody can control the boys of Cliffwood, he
ought to. But I’ve got an errand in town, so I’ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
have to break away from you, expecting to see you
at the house at eight sharp tomorrow morning.
Then ho! for the shellbarks by the bushel, enough
for a whole winter’s supply.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be in such a big hurry, Leslie,” urged
Dick.</p>

<p>“What! have you got another dark secret to
tell me?” demanded the other, laughingly.</p>

<p>Dick looked cautiously around him. Then he
nodded his head.</p>

<p>“It’s a sure enough secret this time,” he observed,
in a lowered voice. “Wait up a minute,
because there’s Deacon Nocker coming along the
street, and of all the people in Cliffwood he’s the
last I’d want to have overhear what I’m going
to tell you.”</p>

<p>Of course, this excited the curiosity of Leslie
more than ever. He managed to hold his feelings
in check while the grim old storekeeper walked
past. Deacon Nocker gave the two boys one malicious
look, and with a sneer on his thin face said:</p>

<p>“Hatching up some more of your tricks, I expect.
But I give you plain warning that these
scandalous goings-on are not to be tolerated any
longer in a respectable town like Cliffwood. Better
be going home and doing your chores. Loafing
on street corners never gave any boy a lift in
life; but it has helped many a lad to start to the
penitentiary.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>Then the worthy deacon walked on with his
head lifted proudly, as though he really believed
he had fulfilled his duty as a Christian in warning
the boys of the rocks upon which they were
drifting, even though he had not stretched out a
helping hand to assist them.</p>

<p>“The old curmudgeon!” muttered Leslie.
“How he does hate all boys! No wonder his
own son ran away from home years ago. Say,
that big house must have seemed like a cold storage
plant to that boy, for there couldn’t have been
anything like warmth and happiness inside of it,
with Old Jed Nocker present. I’m glad he isn’t
any relation to me, that’s all I can say.”</p>

<p>“Listen, Leslie,” Dick continued, lowering his
voice still more. “You’ll think it queer, I know,
but all the same it’s about that same boy, Amos
Nocker, that I’m going to say something right
now.”</p>

<p>“But look here, Dick, didn’t we hear some time
ago that Amos had married, and later on died far
away out West somewhere?”</p>

<p>“It was true too, Leslie. He married a sweet
little girl, and for a time managed to support her
in comfort, because Amos had turned over a new
leaf, you see. Then he came down with tuberculosis,
and trouble stepped in.”</p>

<p>“Whew! that was rough,” said the other, his
boyish heart touched with genuine sympathy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
“And just after Amos was getting a fair start,
too. But why didn’t he write to his rich father
and get help?”</p>

<p>“He did, but his letter was returned unopened,”
Dick explained. “In the end poor Amos Nocker
died, just as we heard.”</p>

<p>“Leaving a widow and a child.”</p>

<p>“Just what it was, Leslie—the sweetest little
woman you ever knew, and the boy is a darling if
ever there was one. You see she wrote to the old
man telling him about Amos’ sad death, and that
she and the boy were almost penniless.”</p>

<p>“Did that touch the heart of Jed Nocker?”</p>

<p>“He answered her letter, and what do you
think he said?” continued Dick, between his set
teeth. “That as for her, he vowed never to set
eyes on the face of the woman who had married
his boy, thinking to come into some of his father’s
hard-earned money; but that if she chose to send
the child on to him he would care for it. But <i>she</i>
must never darken his doors with her presence.”</p>

<p>“The cold-blooded old wretch!” burst out Leslie,
indignantly. “But see here, Dick, how do you
happen to know all this?”</p>

<p>“For the simple reason that Amos Nocker’s
young widow, and the child, little Billy, are over
at our house right now!” came the astonishing answer
that staggered the listener, and caused him to
gasp as he stared at Dick.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br>

<small>SETTING THE FOX TRAP</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">That’s</span> a queer thing you’re telling me, Dick!”
was what Leslie Capes finally observed, scanning
the face of his chum closely.</p>

<p>“After all it isn’t so very strange,” explained the
other. “My mother once knew a Matilda Smith,
and corresponded with her for some years. She
married and was Tilly’s mother, it turned out, and
Tilly is the girl Amos Nocker married. So among
her mother’s letters Tilly found the address of our
folks, and seeing it was Cliffwood, where her unforgiving
father-in-law lived, she wrote on.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Then your mother had her come here and
to her house, did she, Dick?”</p>

<p>“Just what happened, though I didn’t get wind
of the secret till she arrived today,” Dick hastened
to explain.</p>

<p>“But what’s the game?” questioned Leslie,
eagerly. “Your mother and Grandpop Horner
must have something up their sleeves.”</p>

<p>“Just what they have,” admitted Frank, with
flashing eyes. “And say, after seeing what a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
dandy little darling that Billy is I reckon it might
have a ghost of a chance of succeeding; though
lots of people would laugh at the idea of a child
breaking through into the flinty old heart of Jed
Nocker.”</p>

<p>“Go on and tell me what’s up,” urged Leslie,
almost consumed with curiosity.</p>

<p>“Listen, then,” Dick continued, mysteriously.
“My mother hasn’t made up her mind that Mr.
Nocker is hopeless. She really believes that in
secret he has suffered a whole lot for his hardness
to poor Amos.”</p>

<p>“Huh! I guess she’s about the only person in
town then that believes so,” grumbled Leslie. “Everybody
else thinks he’s got no heart at all, but
a frozen turnip in its place. What makes your
mother believe that, Dick?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the other, “for one thing, she had
occasion to go into his private office a week or
so ago. She thought he called out ‘come in’ when
she knocked, but when she opened the door Jed
was standing there looking at a picture of poor
Amos that he had on top of his rolltop desk; and
he blew his nose a whole lot when he saw her.
Mother says she felt sure his eyes looked watery.”</p>

<p>Leslie gave a mocking laugh at that.</p>

<p>“It never could have happened, Dick, believe
me!” he exclaimed. “Chances were he only had
a bad cold in the head; lots of it around town at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
this time of the year, and among older people especially.
But you hinted at some sort of a plan
that our folks had been making up.”</p>

<p>“My mother has a strong notion, which has
become a positive conviction since seeing the fine
little chap, that if Old Jed could become interested
in Billy, not knowing that it was his own grandchild
he was beginning to care for, he might in the
end consent to accepting Tilly as his daughter, and
provide for them.”</p>

<p>“H’m! sounds pretty nice, but knowing Mr.
Nocker as well as I do I’m pretty shaky about the
scheme working. But how could we go about it,
Dick?”</p>

<p>“We’d have to get somebody interested who
could afford to put a little money in the plan,” explained
Dick, hesitatingly.</p>

<p>“How about my Uncle Henry?” demanded the
other, instantly. “He’s just the one to plunge into
anything of that kind, recklessly.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure he would be glad of the chance to
help,” Dick went on to say, “after he had met Tilly
and little Billy. And Leslie, you know the old
saying, ‘speak of an angel and you’ll hear his
wings?’ Well, there comes your uncle right now.”</p>

<p>“I’ll hold him up, Dick, and you can explain the
whole thing to him. Then, if you say the word,
we’ll all go to your house and meet Tilly Nocker
and Billy. Hello! Uncle Henry, we were just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
talking about you. Are you in a big hurry, or
could you spare a little time to listen to something
my chum Dick here wants to say?”</p>

<p>The gentleman spoken to was a middle-aged,
pleasant-faced man, and Leslie had for years come
to look upon him as his good fairy. He supplied
the lad with funds, perhaps too generously, but
Uncle Henry’s faith in boys was deep-rooted, so
that he believed they would come through all
right. He looked upon them as certain to exhibit
a certain number of prank-loving propensities,
even as they caught the measles.</p>

<p>“It happens that I’ve got plenty of time on my
hands just now, boys,” he told them. “What is
the trouble at present? Been getting in some
farmer’s orchard, and he threatens to make trouble
for you if you don’t pay for the damage done?”</p>

<p>Leslie laughed at hearing this.</p>

<p>“A bad guess that time, Uncle Henry,” he told
the gentleman, much to his relief. “We’re going
to cut out most of that sort of business, now that
Mr. Holwell has started to organize a Boys’ Department
of the Y. M. C. A. Dick here wants
to enlist your co-operation in a little scheme that
his mother is engineering; and Uncle, I’ve as good
as said I knew you’d jump at the chance to help.”</p>

<p>“Thanks for your good opinion, Nephew,”
laughed the other. “But suppose you tell me what
it’s all about before I make any promises.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>“Of course you know all about Amos Nocker,
sir,” began Dick; “and how when he died away
out West, his widow wrote asking the old deacon
for help, which he refused to give unless she
handed over her little son to him, with a promise
never to even try to see him?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Uncle Henry, gruffly, “I’ve
heard about that, and thought it just about as mean
and cold-blooded a proposition as ever was made.
To think of making the poor young widow give
up her child unless she wanted to starve! But
then what more could you expect from Old Jed
Nocker, the Icicle of Cliffwood?”</p>

<p>“Well, both Tilly and her child, little Billy,
are over at our house right now,” continued Dick,
eagerly. “Of course, it’s a dead secret, and you
two are the only ones who know it. She’s meaning
to go under the name of Mrs. Smith, you see.”</p>

<p>Uncle Henry looked decidedly interested.</p>

<p>“Tell me what’s in the wind, Dick, for I believe
you said your mother had some sort of scheme.”</p>

<p>“It’s just this way, sir,” explained Dick. “You
know the Brandon place next door to the deacon’s
is empty, and for rent, furnished or empty. My
mother thought that if Tilly took that house, and
just by accident, you see, little Billy managed to
creep through a hole in the fence between the
places, and Mr. Nocker happened to run across
him, he might become interested in the child.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>“Whew! that’s the game, is it?” exclaimed
Leslie.</p>

<p>Uncle Henry seemed to ponder over it for a full
minute or so.</p>

<p>“There’s a chance it might work,” he finally
admitted; “though a whole lot would depend on
the lad himself, as well as the state Old Jed has
reached. Some profess to believe he’s beginning
to break under the strain. For myself I must confess
I’ve seen no signs of it so far; he’s just as
hard as ever.”</p>

<p>“Well, it might turn out that he’s trying to keep
up a brave face even when he’s near breaking
down,” said Dick, quickly. “My mother surprised
him looking at a picture of Amos one day, and
she is sure his eyes were wet. And as far as little
Billy is concerned, sir, if you come over to our
house and meet him, I think you’ll say he can turn
the trick, if anything can.”</p>

<p>“Is he such a darling, then?” asked Uncle
Henry, who, although an old bachelor himself,
had a fondness for children.</p>

<p>“Wait till you see him, and then tell me, sir,”
replied Dick, confidently.</p>

<p>“All right, we’ll go over with you now if you
say so, Dick,” the generous gentleman hastened
to say.</p>

<p>“And after you’ve met Tilly and her little boy,
sir,” continued Dick, anxious to strike while the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
iron was hot, “if you think well of the scheme will
you go and secure the Brandon house for a month,
so they can move in tomorrow?”</p>

<p>“I’ll be only too glad to do that, my boy,” replied
Uncle Henry, laying a hand affectionately
on a shoulder of each of the chums, while he
beamed down upon the flushed face of Dick
through his glasses. “It would be well worth a
month’s rent to me, or ten months for that matter,
if I could have a hand in breaking up that iron
will of Old Jed Nocker, and making him a little
bit human.”</p>

<p>“How about your errand, Leslie, can it wait?”
asked Dick.</p>

<p>“Shucks! It’ll have to,” laughed the other;
“because you see I was only going to have a haircut,
and what are a few stray locks between
friends. Come on, let’s get a move on. I’m wild
to see that little Billy and his mother.”</p>

<p>They were not long in reaching the white cottage
near the bank of the murmuring river where
Dick, his small sister Sue, his mother, and the old
pensioner lived.</p>

<p>When Dick threw open the door and ushered
his two companions into the room they stood there
and stared. A handsome little curly-haired boy of
about three was playing horse with a chair which
he straddled like a trooper. Leslie thought he had
never set eyes on a more winning little chap, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
stock in Dick’s plan immediately sprang up far
above par in his mind.</p>

<p>Tilly Nocker jumped to her feet as they entered.
She was a pretty young woman, perhaps too sad
for one of her tender years. Uncle Henry became
interested in her immediately, for he saw that she
had suffered.</p>

<p>Dick’s mother and grandfather were also present.
The former was worthy of any boy’s love,
for her whole disposition was that of a gentle,
trusting woman. As for the veteran of the Civil
War, with his shock of white hair coming down
almost to his shoulders, and his clean-cut features,
he made a striking picture.</p>

<p>“Mother, I’ve brought Leslie and Uncle Henry
over to meet them!” burst out Dick. “They know
what we plan to do, and Uncle Henry seems to
be pretty much in favor of it already.”</p>

<p>“Without saying another word,” remarked the
gentleman, quickly, “I want to tell you I think it
well worth trying. If Mr. Nocker can resist that
winsome little chap then he’s got a lump of ice in
place of a heart. I’m glad to meet you, Mrs.
Nocker, and let me tell you that in all Cliffwood
you couldn’t have found a better haven of rest
than right here in Mrs. Horner’s cottage.”</p>

<p>He shook hands with Tilly, and then hurried
over to make the acquaintance of little Billy.
While Uncle Henry had always been deeply interested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
in children, he could not remember the
time he had ever been so drawn to a bright-faced
little chap as he was now.</p>

<p>Deep down in his heart he was saying something
like this:</p>

<p>“If the old skinflint doesn’t come to time I’ve
got a good notion to adopt them both myself,
and perhaps I will yet. One thing sure, they must
never come to want. Why, it would be worth all
it cost just to have that manly little chap around
all the time.”</p>

<p>Before Dick and his uncle were ready to go it
had all been settled.</p>

<p>“I’ll take a short lease on the Brandon place inside
of half an hour,” announced Uncle Henry,
positively, which showed that he was a man who
never allowed the grass to grow under his feet
when he had an object in view. “You can get settled
tomorrow. We’ll keep the secret sacredly,
and the town will only know you as Mrs. Smith.
Then some time next week start the machinery
moving.”</p>

<p>After Uncle Henry had hurried away to fulfill
his part in the contract, Dick and Leslie stood
outside the door to exchange a few words ere the
latter walked off.</p>

<p>“The trap is set,” Leslie said, “and now we’ll
see if the cunning old fox can be tempted to take
the bait.”</p>

<small>TAKING THE BAIT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the great news concerning the boys of
Cliffwood had circulated around town during the
next few days it created no end of talk. Everywhere
it caused the most intense excitement among
the rising generation. Parents in particular commended
the plan of Mr. Holwell as a means for
gripping the restless activities of the town boys,
and turning them into some more useful channel
than loitering about the streets at night and playing
all sorts of practical jokes.</p>

<p>At school it was the subject of talk wherever
two or three fellows came together on the campus,
or while in the classrooms during intermission.</p>

<p>Nearly every boy was in favor of the scheme.
They talked it over and saw all manner of splendid
possibilities looming up, for not only the long
evenings of the coming winter but even during the
spring and summer months.</p>

<p>“I’ve handed in my application,” announced
Phil Harkness, as with several other fellows he
stood in the school basement keeping warm near<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
the furnace, while he munched some lunch purchased
at the counter. “I hope nothing blocks me
in joining the Juniors, because I expect they’re
going to have great times.”</p>

<p>“Mighty few fellows try to throw cold water
on the idea,” ventured Dan Fenwick; “unless it’s
Nat Silmore and Dit Hennesy, who’ve gone
around sneering, and saying it’s all a bunk game
on the part of Mr. Holwell and Harry Bartlett
to keep boys from having good times playing
tricks.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but even they’re talking of applying for
admission,” spoke up Clint Babbett; “and it
wouldn’t surprise me if we had a heap of trouble
with that crowd. If they get in to the first meeting
which has been called for tomorrow night, look
out for squalls, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Holwell thinks they are not as black as
they’re painted,” suggested Peg Fosdick. “But
that’s because he’s got such a big heart he just
can’t decide that any sort of boy is beyond redemption.”</p>

<p>“If they come in,” asserted Dan, vigorously,
“there’ll be a rumpus, as sure as you’re born. I
wish there were going to be some of the Seniors
present, but I understand that it’s an off night for
them, and that only Mr. Holwell, with perhaps
Harry Bartlett, can be present at the first meeting.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>“Oh! well, where do we all come in?” demanded
Peg, puffing out his chest in a vainglorious fashion.
“We’ll chase that crowd out in a hurry if they get
too gay. Besides, police headquarters is close by,
and Mr. Holwell could call them up on the ’phone
if it got too smoky.”</p>

<p>“I understand that nearly two dozen applications
are already in,” remarked Phil, “so there
ought to be something of a crowd out at the meeting.
I’m wild to know just what the plans are.”</p>

<p>“First of all,” said Peg, “there’s going to be a
small initiation fee, and monthly dues, just to help
pay expenses, and make the boys feel it isn’t a charity.
That’s Mr. Holwell’s idea; he doesn’t believe
boys like to be given everything. And one
of the rules is going to be that they must earn
the amount of their entering fee and dues.”</p>

<p>“Wow! I see my finish then,” groaned Andy
Hale; “because this morning my dad tempted me
with an offer to saw and split a cord or two of
wood that’s piled up in our back yard. Now I’ll
just <i>have</i> to agree, if he’ll advance the pay to me.”</p>

<p>“Some of the boys,” explained Phil, “are going
to be given a chance to do certain things about the
Y. M. C. A. building, such as taking care of the
furnace, cleaning windows at odd hours, and the
like.”</p>

<p>“A good idea, too,” admitted Peg, “because
some of the fellows who work in the mills would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
want to join us, you see, and they couldn’t afford
to stand for the admittance fee.”</p>

<p>“Uncle Henry Capes has let it be known that
he stands ready to assist any worthy boy he thinks
is in dead earnest, and who can’t afford the price,”
announced Leslie.</p>

<p>“Bully for your uncle, Leslie; he’s all right!”
cried Peg, enthusiastically.</p>

<p>“Here’s another thing, fellows, I’m meaning to
bring up the first chance I get after the Boys’ Department
is well started,” said Phil. “You know
all of us have been a whole lot annoyed by Mr.
Loft, the librarian, who believes all boys’ books
should be thrown out of our Public Library, and
only volumes along educational lines kept there.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” broke in Dan, eagerly. “I never
call for a book that I’ve wanted to read but that
he tried to show me the folly of indulging in such
silly nonsense as he calls it. Guess the high-brow
Mr. Loft never was a boy himself. He must have
been fed on Greek grammar and ancient history
when he was six years old. He makes me tired,
that’s what. But go on and tell us what you’ve
been thinking up, Phil.”</p>

<p>“All right, I will, fellows,” replied the one
spoken to. “In the beginning I want to say I’ve
already talked the matter over with Mr. Holwell,
Harry Bartlett, and Leslie’s Uncle Henry, and
all of them took to the idea first rate.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>“Go on, and let’s hear!” called out several of
the more impatient lads as they clustered around
the speaker.</p>

<p>“Listen then,” said Phil, impressively. “After
we get the Junior Club well started the idea is
to have a library of our own, containing only such
books as Mr. Holwell will have passed upon as
being the right sort for boys to read. These can
be filled with pleasing adventure such as all boys
want, and at the same time be of a healthy, uplifting
nature, and all our own.”</p>

<p>“Fine!” exclaimed Dan Fenwick, who was a
great reader of stories of all sorts.</p>

<p>“We could buy the books ourselves with money
we earned or had given to us,” declared Clint Babbett.
“I know for one thing my mother will take
to the scheme right away, because she hates to
have me fetch home some of the greasy looking
books from the public library. You see, she
says you never can tell where they’ve been the week
before; mebbe in a house where they have diphtheria
or some sort of catching disease. Germs
she hates the worst kind. Yes, she’ll be only too
glad to help out.”</p>

<p>From all sides the idea was commended. No
one had ever thought of such an original scheme
before, though some of the boys had pretty extensive
libraries of their own covering shelves of
space in their dens at home, and consisting, for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
most part, of modern books for growing lads, such
as the well-meaning but short-sighted librarian disliked
to see them taking from the public institution.</p>

<p>Dick, coming along just then, was told of the
new scheme.</p>

<p>“I think it’s a good idea of yours, Phil,” he
declared as soon as it had been explained to him.
“Like the rest of you I’ve grown tired of having
Mr. Loft forever looking so disgusted whenever
I ask for a book by my favorite writer who knows
boys, and writes straight down into their hearts.”</p>

<p>“Let them keep the library just for works of
educational value if they want,” asserted the proud
originator of the idea; “although few people think
that’s the only function for a public institution.”</p>

<p>“Most boys get all the instruction they need in
school,” asserted Peg; “and to read a good boy’s
book, something along the line of outdoor sports,
is one of their best recreations. Think of how
every one of us, yes and our daddies and grandfathers,
as well, have poured over such classics as
Robinson Crusoe and Swiss Family Robinson.”</p>

<p>“Sure thing,” added Dick, convincingly, “and
a good book keeps a boy from getting into heaps
of mischief; because he’s just <i>got</i> to be doing something.
But there goes the bell, fellows. Hope to
see all of you on hand at the first meeting of the
Junior Organization.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>“We’ll be there, you can bet, Dick!” cried Peg,
as he limped after the rest to resume his studies.</p>

<p>That afternoon Leslie Capes caught up with
Dick as the latter was hastening home from school.</p>

<p>“I’m in a hurry to get home, Leslie,” said the
latter, “but I wish you’d keep me company part of
the way. Somehow or other I haven’t had much
chance to get a few words with you on the sly so
as to tell you how our little plan is moving along.”</p>

<p>“I’m just burning up with curiosity to know
about that same, Dick. Has Old Nocker run
across little Billy yet?”</p>

<p>“He certainly has,” replied Dick, promptly. “It
happened yesterday. I showed Billy the very hole
in the dividing fence through which we crawled
on the Hallowe’en night, and, knowing Mr.
Nocker was home at the time, I hid near so as to
watch and see what happened.”</p>

<p>“Well, please go on, Dick; you’ve got me all
worked up,” pleaded Leslie.</p>

<p>“Little Billy understood what he was to do, and
wandered around the place, by degrees getting
nearer and nearer the house. Then all at once I
saw the old deacon hurrying out toward him. He
looked cross, as if he meant to order the child off
his grounds, and complain, in the bargain, to his
parents if he ever trespassed again.”</p>

<p>“But he didn’t, Dick; I know you’re going to say
he didn’t,” urged Leslie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>“Well, I could see him talking to little Billy
for a while,” Dick went on. “Then he even bent
down so as to get closer to him. Say, I warrant
you there was something queer happening inside
his frosty old heart just then. Perhaps he could
see some familiar glimpse in little Billy’s blue
eyes that made him think of the boy he once had.”</p>

<p>“What do you think he could have said to
Billy?” asked Leslie.</p>

<p>“Oh! I saw him pointing toward the Brandon
house through the trees, for with the leaves off he
could get a glimpse of it from where he stood. So
I knew he must be asking if the little curly-head
lived there.”</p>

<p>“Yes, go on, Dick.”</p>

<p>“Finally, I saw Billy start to come back, and
would you believe it Old Jed actually laid a hand
on his mop of golden hair. Like as not that was
the first time he’d ever willingly touched a child
since his Amos was a kid.”</p>

<p>“Splendid, Dick! Things seem to be working
along just as we planned them, don’t they?”</p>

<p>“When the little boy walked away, Old Jed
stood and stared after him. Then I saw him shake
his head and go back in the direction of the house.
But three times he turned and looked after Billy
until the kid was lost to sight.”</p>

<p>“And did you manage to find out what he said
to the child, Dick?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>“Partly,” came the reply. “Billy told us the
nice old gentleman had asked him who he was, and
about his folks. Then as Billy was coming away
Old Jed told him he must come again, and see him
another day—tomorrow if it was pleasant.”</p>

<p>At that Leslie almost doubled up.</p>

<p>“The sly old fox has swallowed the bait, Dick!”
he exclaimed, between laughs. “All you have to
do now is to let him have rope enough, and he’ll
be caught as neat as you please. When he’s got
to just <i>yearn</i> for little Billy, it’ll be time to pull
the string, and tell him he can only have the child’s
company on condition that the mother is equally
welcome in his home.”</p>

<p>“I think myself that things begin to look kind
of promising,” admitted Dick. “You must be sure
to tell Uncle Henry all about it.”</p>

<p>“I certainly will,” continued Leslie, “and my
mother as well, because she’s in the secret too. But
about that meeting called for tomorrow night—have
you heard that Nat and several of his cronies
mean to attend?”</p>

<p>“If they do, it’ll be to make trouble for the rest
of us, for they’ll try to break the meeting up,”
said Dick, vehemently. “It would be only right
if Mr. Holwell had the police chief present to keep
things serene; but I suppose that wouldn’t look
nice, seeing we would be in the Y. M. C. A.
rooms.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br>

<small>ORGANIZING THE BOYS’ DEPARTMENT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Along</span> about a quarter to eight on the evening
of the following day a number of eager lads
might have been seen making their way in the direction
of the central part of town.</p>

<p>The building which had been taken for the use
of the now firmly established Y. M. C. A. was
fairly well adapted to the purpose, though a few
changes had been made to suit the needs of the
association.</p>

<p>It was a substantial residence, with a hall in
the center, and large rooms on either side. The
extensive cellar had been made into a splendid
gymnasium, where basket ball as well could be
played on occasion.</p>

<p>The double parlor made an excellent hall where
entertainments were given, consisting of lectures
and educational motion pictures. On the other
side were two pleasant rooms where games, such
as dominoes, chess and checkers, could be indulged
in.</p>

<p>Altogether, it was a most comfortable place to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
spend the winter evenings. Even a billiard and
a pool table had been installed, with the idea of
keeping the young men from patronizing rooms
where strong drink was apt to be sold. Better
still, there was now a new bowling alley being built
as an addition to the plant, which would prove
unusually attractive to many fond of rolling.</p>

<p>A number of boys traveling toward this center
of interest came together at some little distance
away. Dick nudged his chum, Leslie, when he saw
that Nat Silmore and two of his chosen friends
made up the other detachment.</p>

<p>Nat seemed to be in a hilarious mood. Evidently,
he was pleased over something or other,
and whenever he laughed his cronies in duty bound
joined in the merriment.</p>

<p>“Seems like we’re all out on the same errand
this beautiful night, eh, Dick?” he remarked, with
a chuckle, as the two parties merged in one, and
pushed on toward the building with its many lights.</p>

<p>“Everybody’s doing it!” chanted Dit Hennesy,
at which the trio gave a hearty laugh, and slapped
one another roughly on the back, as though they
were fairly bubbling over with glee, for some reason
or other.</p>

<p>Dick did not exactly like the signs. He had
seen Nat in this condition before, and to his observing
mind it always presaged some sort of outbreak
that had a bold prank attached to it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>His mind went back to a former occasion, when
the big, overgrown boy had kept up his chuckling,
though there seemed nothing humorous in the eyes
of others; yet all of a sudden every light in the
town hall had gone out, leaving Polly Cramer,
who was in the midst of her graduation essay, almost
hysterical with fright.</p>

<p>But then there was no necessity to pick a quarrel
with Nat. Surely Mr. Holwell and big Harry
Bartlett ought to be able to manage a wild team
like Nat and Dit.</p>

<p>“Well, this is a great night for the boys of Cliffwood,
according to my notion,” Dick remarked.
“I’m only sorry for the fellows who can’t manage
to get into the new organization, for it promises
to be a big thing.”</p>

<p>“Think so, do you?” sneered Nat. “Well,
’cording to my mind there’s plenty of good times
floatin’ all around, and you don’t have to sneeze
every time Harry Bartlett or the minister takes
snuff, to find ’em.”</p>

<p>“But you’re going in tonight, aren’t you?”
asked Dan Fenwick, who was tagging along at the
heels of Dick and Leslie.</p>

<p>“Sure we are,” replied the other, boisterously.
“We took a notion we’d like to hear what’s on
tap. Mebbe we’ll condescend to hand in our names
along with the mob if it sounds good to us; mebbe
we won’t. It all depends.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>There was nothing funny about these words of
Nat’s, and yet the other two boys thought fit to
start laughing again as though they could not contain
themselves.</p>

<p>“Oh! you’ll have to please yourselves about
that, I guess, Nat,” observed Dick, carelessly.
“Nobody is going to be coaxed to join the club,
as I understand it. So far as we’ve heard the plan
outlined, I should say that the fellow who declines
to enroll and obey the few rules is going to miss
heaps of good times this winter.”</p>

<p>“Huh! mebbe now you’re givin’ me a sly dig,
Dick Horner,” grunted Nat, “when you talk ’bout
obeying rules.”</p>

<p>“No more than I was giving myself a knock,
Nat, because I’ve been a pretty lively customer
and hard to curb, I own up. But if the cap fits,
put it on, because there <i>are</i> going to be rules, and
Mr. Holwell has said distinctly that unless they’re
lived up to no fellow will be allowed to remain
a member, even if he does join.”</p>

<p>“Strikes me Mr. Holwell is goin’ to bite off
more’n he can chew this time,” observed Nat,
which started another series of loud chuckles from
his “echoes.”</p>

<p>“They mean trouble as sure as two and two
are four,” whimpered Leslie into Dick’s ear, as the
three rough fellows fell back a few paces, apparently
to hold a little confab of their own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>“Let them start a rough-house prank if they
want to,” said Dick, confidently. “I miss my guess
if Mr. Holwell isn’t able to handle the crowd. He
used to be on the college football squad years ago,
and knows a thing or two about hustling a disturber
out of a meeting, even if he is a minister.”</p>

<p>“If you asked me what I thought,” added Dan,
eagerly, “I’d say there’s a little surprise waiting
up for Nathan this very night; and for one I’ll
be tickled half to death when it happens. It’s been
due some time now, I expect.”</p>

<p>“Well, here we are at the place,” remarked
Dick; “so let’s forget all about such a thing as
trouble.”</p>

<p>When the boys found themselves inside the
building it was to meet a score of their schoolmates,
all waiting in the big auditorium for the
meeting to be called to order. In the upper part
of the house were a couple of quiet reading rooms
for those who did not wish to be disturbed by such
noise as arose from the lovers of games. There
were also accommodations for temporary shelter,
where several young men could room during their
search for work.</p>

<p>Mr. Holwell and Harry Bartlett were present,
looking more than gratified over such a good turnout
on the part of the boys of Cliffwood. The attendance
seemed to insure the ultimate success of
their new undertaking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>“Of course we must expect to meet with obstacles,”
the minister was saying to his right-hand
man; “perhaps plenty of them; for nothing worth
while can be attained without great efforts. But
with a splendid body of eager boys back of us
there can be no such word as fail in our lexicon.”</p>

<p>When eight o’clock came, the meeting was
promptly called to order by Mr. Holwell. He
found himself faced by nearly a score and a half
of boys, most of them anxious to qualify for membership
in the new organization.</p>

<p>Some of them with older brothers in the regular
Y. M. C. A. had long envied the good times
the Seniors seemed to have under that hospitable
roof. Now that a chance had come whereby they
too were to be given a share in the pleasures and
entertainments that enlivened the dull winter
months there was no lack of enthusiasm exhibited
on every hand.</p>

<p>Nat Silmore and his cronies kept close together.
Dick now and then cast a look in their direction,
and wondered if they really would have the nerve
to try and give Mr. Holwell trouble. Knowing
the effrontery of Nat so well, he had a strong suspicion
that something was brewing.</p>

<p>“Most of you already know the main object of
this meeting,” said Mr. Holwell, after his upraised
hand had called for silence. “Some of us a bit
ago came to the conclusion that the growing boys<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
of Cliffwood had been neglected too long, and that
it was high time something was done to give them
much more pleasure than can be found on the
streets of nights. So we are now about to offer
all of you the opportunity of becoming junior members
of the Y. M. C. A.”</p>

<p>At that Dick led the cheering, and quite a tumult
arose. It was to be noticed, however, that
Nat and his two followers did not join in the applause.
Dick wondered why this should be; he
was already suspicious of them, for he could see
Dit nudging Nat in the ribs and grinning, whereupon
the big fellow shook his head, as though he
might be curbing the impatience of his followers.</p>

<p>When Mr. Holwell elevated his hand again the
cheering stopped as if by magic. Every fellow
leaned forward and listened to hear what was coming
next.</p>

<p>“Any boy living in or around Cliffwood can
become a member in full standing of our Junior
Organization,” continued the minister, “provided
he pays an initiation fee of two dollars, earned
by himself, and the monthly dues of twenty-five
cents. He must be between the ages of eight and
eighteen years of age, and will have to subscribe
to the few general rules whereby he promises to
behave himself as becomes a member of the Y. M.
C. A. These rules you will find on the cards I
shall give out later on.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>As he paused it gave the assembly another
chance to let loose with three cheers. Mr. Holwell
did not try to stop them. He knew that boys
must find a vent for their enthusiasm in some fashion,
when too full to keep still.</p>

<p>“Those who join will be entitled to nearly all
the privileges of this building, such as the gymnasium
on certain occasions, the swimming pool
that, with the bowling alleys, is being fitted up for
immediate use; and will be allowed to attend such
lectures and entertainments as are considered suitable
for boys of their age.”</p>

<p>A third whirlwind of applause interrupted the
speaker. That manifestation of approval pleased
the big-hearted minister more than anything else.
He knew that he had secured a firm hold on the
hearts and affections of most of these lively lads;
and no doubt had visions of the great good his
latest plan was bound to bring about for the
younger generation of Cliffwood.</p>

<p>“As time passes,” he went on to tell them, “there
will arise various ways of enlisting your hearty co-operation
in the work. I have already suggested
one scheme that I am pleased to say seems to have
met the approval of the committee in charge of entertainments.</p>

<p>“Perhaps all of you may not know that in my
younger years, before I ever thought of preaching
the Gospel, I belonged to a minstrel company<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
that was more or less of a success in its traveling
career. Now my plan is to have the boys of the
Y. M. C. A. give a refined show of this sort, in
which nearly every one of you can take some part.
It is also proposed to offer a cash prize of twenty-five
dollars in gold to the boy who can get up the
best original farce suited for minstrel work, the
entertainment committee being the judges. More
particulars of this plan will be given out at the
meeting of the club next week.”</p>

<p>“Will every member be permitted to enter this
competition, sir?” asked Dick.</p>

<p>“There will be no restriction,” continued Mr.
Holwell, “and every boy who belongs to the junior
league of the association is entitled to try for
the reward. Only it must be understood that all
work must be original. And now if you are ready
to register your names as candidates for acceptance
we will see how many can be enrolled tonight.”</p>

<p>As before, there were cheers from the boys, but
this time the din became really frightful. Nat and
his two cronies had produced harsh sirens from
their pockets, and persisted in blowing them to the
utmost extent of their lungs.</p>

<p>In vain Mr. Holwell and Harry Bartlett held
up their hands to implore silence. Most of the
boys stopped cheering, but the three kept up their
racket as though bent on breaking up the meeting
then and there.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br>

<small>THE FIGHTING PARSON</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Silence</span>!”</p>

<p>Dick could see Mr. Holwell’s lips form this
word, but his voice was utterly unable to rise
above the horrible din produced by the three
hoarse sirens blown in company, with might and
main by the plotters. Nat and his companions
were turning red in the face with their efforts,
yet gave no sign of slowing up.</p>

<p>Leslie gripped Dick’s arm. He was furious
with indignation, and had Dick given him the signal,
no doubt he stood ready to hurl himself on
the nearest disturber of the meeting, and try to
snatch the instrument of ear torture from his
grasp.</p>

<p>Apparently, the minister had reached the end
of his patience. He doubtless realized that this
din was not occasioned through simple boyish enthusiasm,
but must mark a well-arranged plot to
break up the first meeting of the Boys’ Department.</p>

<p>The very fact that Nat led the disturbers of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
the peace was highly significant, for the Silmore
boy’s reputation was anything but savory in the
annals of Cliffwood’s rising generation.</p>

<p>If Nat counted on Mr. Holwell being a man
of peace because he wore the garb of a minister,
he made one of the greatest mistakes of his life.
Those who knew the reverend gentleman better
could have told him that for a man of his years
he was as fine an athlete as could be found in that
section of the country.</p>

<p>Harry Bartlett was now alongside Mr. Holwell.
His face was white with indignation, and his eyes
sparkled dangerously. Watching anxiously, Dick
saw the minister suddenly turn toward the Y. M.
C. A. leader, and nod his head. He may have
spoken something at the same time, though only
Harry heard it.</p>

<p>Promptly the two of them pounced upon Nat
and Dit, who, though taken somewhat by surprise,
made a desperate resistance. They were as
pigmies in the hands of the two men, who hustled
them toward the door in great shape, accompanied
by the loud cheers of the assembled boys.</p>

<p>The third young ruffian, seeing Dick and Leslie
making in his direction, promptly threw up his
arms to indicate that he surrendered, and then
bolted for the exit.</p>

<p>When he reached the door, Mr. Holwell held
up a hand again to call for silence, and then sternly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
addressed the boy who was squirming in his iron
grip, amazed at having been handled so vigorously
by the man of peace.</p>

<p>“If any of you give me the least trouble again
tonight,” was what he told Nat, “I promise to call
the Chief of Police up on the ’phone, and have
him lock you up at the station. And you can never
enter these doors again as a prospective member
of the Boys’ League until you have written me an
abject apology for your outrageous conduct tonight.
Now be off with you!”</p>

<p>With that he gave Nat a push and sent him outside
the open door. Nat immediately took to his
heels, in which act he was quickly copied by his
two running mates. Dick saw him turn and look
back over his shoulder as he ran away, and wondered
whether the fist he shook in the air could
have been intended as a threat for himself or Mr.
Holwell.</p>

<p>Just then, however, he gave the matter no further
thought, for he was too full of excitement to
bother about small things like Nat Silmore’s resentment.</p>

<p>The boys once more trooped into the room and
resumed their seats. Mr. Holwell looked as calm
as ever, though he and Harry Bartlett exchanged
a humorous smile or two. Indeed, Dick found
himself wondering if the elder gentleman might
not really have enjoyed forgetting his peaceful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
calling for a brief moment, and proving himself a
muscular Christian, ready to stand up for the
right.</p>

<p>The names were taken down in regular order,
for the boys proved eager to enter themselves as
prospective members of the new organization.
Many had come provided with the money for the
small initiation fee; others were promised a chance
to earn it in due time, and entered under that arrangement.</p>

<p>“I do not want a single boy present to feel that
he is being debarred from joining tonight,” Mr.
Holwell announced, on seeing several hang back.
“Be frank with me, and tell me what you aim to
do so as to earn the amount necessary to pay your
initiation fee. I have some plans arranged,
through the kindness of several friends, and no lad
need lack for a chance to enlist if he wants to become
one of us.”</p>

<p>It ended in every fellow having his name taken
down. A number knew of others not present who
were deeply interested, and, of course, they were
enjoined to act as missionaries, so as to lengthen
the roster of the Boys’ Club.</p>

<p>“I’d be only too well pleased,” said Mr. Holwell,
after all these details had been settled, “if
every boy of a suitable age in and around Cliffwood
belonged to this new association, because I
feel sure it is bound to afford you all some of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
happiest evenings of your lives. We intend to
do everything within reason to make this a pleasant
home for our boys, and in return only ask them
to deal candidly with us. We put you on your
honor to stand by the rules, and ask nothing beyond
that.”</p>

<p>The meeting broke up by nine o’clock, for some
of the boys were young, and their parents would
not care to have them out later than this. Dick
and Leslie walked homeward together, for they
did not live far away from one another. Dan
had been compelled to hurry off, as there was company
at his house, with something of a “feast”
so dear to the heart of the average boy, which he
did not care to miss.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you think of the prospects of the
new organization?” asked Leslie, as he and Dick
walked along, arm in arm.</p>

<p>“Bully!” exclaimed the other, with just such enthusiasm
as one of his nature would be expected
to display. “Twenty-six names on the roll call
already, and more coming. It’s already a big success,
and Mr. Holwell looks as proud as if he’d
won a prize.”</p>

<p>“He’s a fine man, Dick, a splendid man!” declared
Leslie. “I always felt that he was the best
friend the boys of this town ever had. But say, I
was never so tickled in all my life as when he
grabbed Nat by the scruff of his coat, and yanked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
him along to the door. Why, Nat, big bully as he
is, was like a pullet in the grip of Mr. Holwell.”</p>

<p>“And did you see how the minister’s eyes flashed
when he was taking Nat across the floor?” burst
out Dick, with a chuckle of glee. “I guess just
for that minute he must have forgotten all about
his calling, and was just plain Tom Holwell again,
left tackle of the Princeton football squad of years
ago. Wow! it was rich, let me tell you.”</p>

<p>Leslie seemed to be just as much amused as his
chum, for he too laughed heartily as they tramped
along. The minister had made a new place for
himself that night, strange to say, in the hearts
of numerous boys.</p>

<p>“And don’t forget,” continued Dick, “that
Harry Bartlett was right in the same class with
Mr. Holwell. The way he jumped on Dit and
yanked him out of his seat was good for sore eyes.
Why, I picked up Dit’s siren from the floor, where
he dropped it in his big scare. Guess they didn’t
think that gun was loaded, and when it went off
with a bang, they got a shock all right!”</p>

<p>“How about that prize of twenty-five dollars
to be offered for the best original black-face farce,
Dick; think of having a look-in there?” asked Leslie,
who happened to know that the other occasionally
indulged in concocting stories, and, indeed,
had always been considered the best composition
writer in the Cliffwood schools.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>“I haven’t thought much about that yet,” replied
Dick, slowly. “I must say it sounds good
to me. I believe I could get up a farce that would
be full of fun, and clean fun at that. And Leslie,
that money would come in mighty handy to me. I
really need a new suit for one thing, and Grandpop’s
pension spreads out pretty thin when it has
to cover so much.”</p>

<p>“But every time I mention the fact that my
Uncle Henry would be just tickled to lend you any
sum you wanted, Dick——”</p>

<p>“That’s enough, Leslie,” hastily interrupted the
other boy, laying a hand on his chum’s arm, while
his voice trembled a little, though in the darkness
no one could see the tears that gathered in his
eyes. “I told you before I couldn’t come down
to accepting charity, for that’s what it would
really be, though both of you are mighty kind to
offer such a thing.”</p>

<p>“Only a loan, Dick, you know; and you
shouldn’t be so touchy over it.”</p>

<p>“Excuse me, Leslie,” said Dick, drawing in a
long breath. “Perhaps most fellows would look
at it that way, and accept your offer only too
gladly. I might too if it was for my mother, or
Sue; but not for myself. I’d rather go in patched
clothes all my life than knuckle down. Oh, yes,
I am proud, and perhaps foolish, but I just can’t
help it, so don’t say any more.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>Evidently, Leslie knew his chum well enough
to feel certain that argument would not change
his determination, once he had set his mind on a
certain course. On that account then, Leslie
dropped the subject, though it was often troubling
him; and he hoped some way would yet be
found whereby the Horner family might be assisted
without Dick feeling that he was an object
of charity.</p>

<p>“What’s the report from the Brandon place tonight,
Dick?” he asked, in order to turn the conversation
into another channel, as well as satisfy
his own curiosity.</p>

<p>“Everything is moving along as fine as silk,”
his chum replied, cheerfully.</p>

<p>“Old Jed has seen little Billy again then, has
he?” continued Leslie.</p>

<p>“Not a day passes during this fine weather but
they meet,” he was told. “Why, it seems to me the
old man hurries home early in the afternoon more
than he used to do, just as if he was looking forward
to seeing the little chap come along through
the bushes.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I hope it turns out all right in the end,”
said Leslie. “I was telling my mother what we’d
done, for she will keep it a secret, believe me.”</p>

<p>“What did she think of the plan?” demanded
Dick, anxiously, for he had considerable respect
for the opinions of his chum’s mother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>“Why,” replied the other boy, quickly, “she
took to it right from the start, and said it was just
the finest plan she had ever heard of.”</p>

<p>“Well,” continued Dick, confidently, “it’s Mr.
Nocker’s last chance to come in out of the wet.”</p>

<p>“Listen!” exclaimed Leslie, just then, clutching
his chum’s coat sleeve.</p>

<p>“What did you hear?” asked the other.</p>

<p>“I thought it was a chuckle,” replied Leslie,
“but I guess it must have been an engine whistling
away over at the Barrtown crossing. You see this
is the only lonely place we’ve got to pass on the
way home, and if those fellows training with Nat
should take a notion to lay for us, it’d be around
this section.”</p>

<p>“What gives you the idea they’d bother doing
that?” demanded Dick, who himself had been
thinking along the same lines.</p>

<p>“Oh! well, it’d be just like Nat to want to have
revenge on <i>somebody</i> for being thrown out of the
meeting tonight. And I happen to know he hates
you more than he does any other boy in Cliffwood.
Better edge a little further away from that bunch
of bushes, Dick. There, what did I tell you?”</p>

<p>Leslie’s last words were drowned in a series of
harsh cries that sprang from a party of boyish figures
breaking from the suspicious bushes, and leaping
toward the two who were on the road leading
to their separate homes.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

<small>IN SELF-DEFENSE</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Look</span> out, Dick; here’s trouble!” burst from
the lips of Leslie Capes, as he saw the dim forms
of several boys rushing toward him and his chum.</p>

<p>Neither of them seemed to think of turning and
running away. Perhaps it was not in their natures
to flee from such a visible danger as now confronted
them; for a boy has a peculiar idea of what
constitutes his sense of honor, and “showing the
white feather” is usually considered next door to
cowardly.</p>

<p>Besides, they easily guessed the identity of the
fellows who aimed to attack them. In the first
place they were three in number, and both Dick
and Leslie remembered that Nat Silmore had had
two of his cronies with him when ejected so forcibly
from the Y. M. C. A. building.</p>

<p>It was true that the assailants had tried to conceal
part of their faces with their handkerchiefs,
a trick they may have learned from seeing it done
in moving pictures of Western holdups. Dit had
a peculiar way of hunching himself along as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
ran, with one shoulder in advance of his body,
and this trait was so well known to his schoolmates
that Dick quickly recognized it now.</p>

<p>As has been said before, it was rather dark
where the ambuscade had been laid. The bare
bushes were dense, and several trees shut out such
light as the stars dotting the sky overhead chanced
to give.</p>

<p>Both boys drew themselves up in a position of
self-defense. They had not done anything to invite
this treacherous attack on the part of Nat’s
crowd; and at the same time they scorned to flee,
with the jeers of the enemy ringing in their ears.</p>

<p>Indeed, there was not much time given them
to lay any elaborate plan of campaign. Hardly
had they backed up against each other, so as to
show a united front, than the enemy launched its
attack.</p>

<p>Nat must have forgotten such lessons as he had
learned on the football field, regarding the force
and value of a “flying wedge,” for all of them
came along in a string, each fellow for himself.</p>

<p>In that way it was easier for the two who were
on the defensive to hold their ground. Both boys
were fairly well versed in boxing, for athletics
had always been a favorite amusement with them.</p>

<p>“That’s one for you!” snapped Dick, as he delivered
a blow with all his might, that hurled the
leading figure back several paces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>“Oh!” this fellow was heard to exclaim, as he
hastily put his hand up to his face, perhaps to ascertain
whether his nose had started to bleeding.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the other two had closed in, and
there began a swift exchange of blows in which
Dick and Leslie seemed able to hold their own,
though one of the assailants, undoubtedly Nat,
loomed up almost a head above either of them,
and had an extra long reach.</p>

<p>He was so clumsy in his fighting, however, that
he could not duck fast enough to avoid severe punishment,
and every time Dick landed a blow he
could hear Nat give a grunt, as of mingled surprise
and pain.</p>

<p>Of course, the two who were acting on the defensive
did not come off unscathed in such a gruelling
contest. They stopped numerous uppercuts
with their bodies, but through their knowledge of
boxing managed to avoid the worst of the punishment.</p>

<p>For a full minute it was a pretty lively affair
all around. The first fellow had come out of his
daze, after receiving that severe jolt; and, burning
with a desire to retaliate, was trying to work
around so as to attack the enemy in the rear, while
his comrades held their attention in front.</p>

<p>Things might have gone somewhat hard with
Dick and his chum, for the conflict was uneven,
the odds in favor of the foe. Neither of them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
dreamed of shouting out at the top of their lungs,
calling for help. Indeed, no doubt they would
much rather have taken a beating than to exhibit
such weakness.</p>

<p>It was just at this stage of the struggle, when
things were looking a little gloomy for the chums,
that Leslie happened to strike his foot against
something lying on the ground.</p>

<p>He could not see what it was, but some intuition
told him he would be well paid if he could
find a chance to suddenly stoop, and groping with
his hand, investigate.</p>

<p>When his eager fingers closed upon quite a stout
paling that must have been knocked from the
weather-beaten fence near by, he felt like giving
a whoop of sheer delight.</p>

<p>It was all in the game, and Leslie knew no reason
why he should not avail himself of this splendid
opportunity for evening the score. Three
against two seemed heavy odds, according to his
mind; and really that paling must have been lying
there for just the purpose to which he now meant
to put it.</p>

<p>Giving another cry of delight he proceeded to
assail the astonished and bewildered trio. Every
time the cudgel descended there was a howl of
pain, and it was wonderful how quickly the enthusiasm
of the three assailants oozed out. As
Leslie continued to belabor them right and left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
they lost all desire to attack, and thought only of
beating a rapid retreat.</p>

<p>The patter of their fleeing footsteps died away
in the near distance, and the two panting chums
held the battlefield in triumph.</p>

<p>“Wow! that was lively while it lasted, I tell
you!” exclaimed Leslie, between puffs. “I’m only
sorry I didn’t get in as many hard licks on Nat as
I wanted. But he dodged after that first crack.”</p>

<p>“That was a lucky find of yours, I must say!”
declared Dick. “You’d better keep that old paling
and hang it up in your den, decorated with a
blue ribbon, for it certainly took the cake.”</p>

<p>“We’d have fared badly only for my luck in running
across it, I’m afraid,” ventured Leslie, caressing
his “lucky find” as though he had already conceived
more or less affection for the stick of wood.</p>

<p>“Yes, for both of us were getting winded, and
say what you will, three against two are big odds,”
agreed Dick.</p>

<p>“But what under the sun did they do it for?”
demanded the other, with a vein of wonder, as well
as indignation, in his voice. “We hadn’t anything
especial to do with their being thrown out tonight—that
is, more than the rest of the fellows.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I can explain that all right,” Dick told
him, without any hesitation.</p>

<p>“I wish you would then,” urged Leslie, “because
it’s all Greek to me.”</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>“If you studied human nature more you
wouldn’t have any trouble seeing through a millstone
that had a hole in it,” chuckled Dick. “It’s
a queer thing, but I’ve seen it crop up in little chaps
not more than three years old.”</p>

<p>“As how?” continued the other.</p>

<p>“Ever notice some urchin trip, and fall so as
to hurt himself, and how after he scrambles to his
feet he kicks viciously at the nearest person? He
knows it was all his own fault, and yet seeks to
lay the blame on some one else. Well, Nat is built
in just that same way, according to my idea.”</p>

<p>“H’m, let’s see if I get you there, Dick,” remarked
Leslie, slowly. “You mean that he knows
he was kicked out of the meeting by Harry Bartlett
and Mr. Holwell, but being afraid to strike
back at <i>them</i>, he made up his mind to get his revenge
by tackling <i>you</i>—for I believe they thought
you’d be coming along here alone and they could
jump on you in a bunch. Is that the idea, Dick?”</p>

<p>“You’ve got it right, Leslie,” admitted the
other, promptly. “Nat just hates me because up
to now he’s never been able to down me, though
it hasn’t been from lack of trying on his part, you
understand.”</p>

<p>“Well, he can write down another failure,”
laughed Leslie, tenderly caressing his left cheek
where a stray blow had glanced aside, though leaving
a slight abrasion of the skin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>“Thanks to you, mostly,” added Dick, slapping
his chum on the back heartily.</p>

<p>“My club, you mean,” corrected the other hastily.
“As a general thing I like to fight fair, but
when you’re outnumbered, and things look pretty
dark, then’s the time ‘clubs are trumps,’ according
to my notion.”</p>

<p>“If you meet up with any of those fellows tomorrow,
take notice and see if they have a pair of
black eyes among them,” said Dick.</p>

<p>“I’m pretty sure one has!” declared his chum,
“for I saw you give him a straight-from-the-shoulder
crack square in the face. How he did
howl!”</p>

<p>“That must have been my first one, then,”
agreed Dick. “I think the fellow I got was Dit
Hennesy, for I noticed his gait when he rushed us
like a mad bull.”</p>

<p>“Shall we go on now?” asked his chum.</p>

<p>“Well, we might as well, because they don’t
mean to come back and try a second round with
us. The creek lies in that direction, and unless I
miss my guess, by this time they’re laving their
bruises with cold water, and telling each other how
they’d have downed us only for you picking up that
paling.”</p>

<p>Leslie did not throw the “lucky find” away.
Perhaps he meant to take Dick’s advice, and keep
it in a post of honor in his den at home. Then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
when he had boy visitors he could point to it with
pride as he narrated the story of the hold-up.</p>

<p>“Want me to cross over lots with you to your
house, Dick?” he asked, presently, when they had
reached the spot where their trails separated, Dick
having to scale a fence and cross a field in order
to reach his own home.</p>

<p>“Well, I should say not if I know it,” he replied,
laughingly. “Things have come to a pretty
pass if a fellow can’t peep out nights without having
an armed guard and retainer at his side. No
more danger from that crowd, for tonight anyway,
Leslie. See you in the morning.”</p>

<p>“Don’t get thinking too hard about that farce
business, Dick,” cautioned the other boy; “or you’ll
lie awake nights losing sleep. But if you do make
up your mind to go in for that prize I’d like to
wager you’ll land it.”</p>

<p>“I wish I could believe that as easy as you do,
Leslie,” sighed Dick, thinking what a fine thing it
would be for him to have twenty-five dollars of his
own to spend just as wished, even though most of
it must go for the clothes he needed badly.</p>

<p>“And don’t forget, Dick, Mr. Holwell was
particular to say the prize would be in <i>gold</i>. Why,
for one, I don’t believe I ever saw that much
money in gold, outside of a bank. It’s worth working
for. I only wish I was a better hand at composition,
and getting up jokes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>“Why not try, anyhow, Leslie?” urged Dick.
“The more there are in the competition the better
Mr. Holwell will be pleased. And for all your
modesty it might turn out that your farce was the
best of the bunch.”</p>

<p>“Oh! well, p’raps I may try it, just for fun,”
agreed the other. “But if it reads as silly as I’m
afraid it will, you’ll find me putting a match to it
in a hurry.”</p>

<p>“Let some one else be the judge before you do
that,” suggested Dick. “No fellow knows what
he can do till he tries his level best.”</p>

<p>“I won’t make any promises,” was the way Leslie
modestly “hedged,” for he happened to be one
of those boys who shrink from being laughed at.</p>

<p>So the two chums separated, Dick calling out at
the last:</p>

<p>“If your face smarts a whole lot, Leslie, bathe
it in cold water, and then lay a rag saturated with
witch hazel on it when you’re in bed. It’ll pay to
look after it tonight.”</p>

<p>“Guess I will,” came back from the semi-darkness;
and then Dick, whistling a strain or two of
a favorite melody, started across the field toward
his house, which was not so far away from that of
his chum but that they had a home-made telephone
connecting the two, over which many an interesting
confab was held from time to time.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br>

<small>NAT ENTERS THE LIST</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> days passed, and November was half gone.</p>

<p>Two more meetings had been held in the big
room of the Y. M. C. A. building, and fully thirty
boys’ names were on the roll of the new Junior
Department. Some of these fellows belonged to
poor families, but they were just the ones Mr. Holwell
had most in mind when he first conceived the
clever idea of starting a Boys’ League inside the
association.</p>

<p>He had found numerous ways in which to help
those whose folks could not really afford to let
their boys join. Three fellows were given jobs
in connection with the care of the building, for it
happened that the association did not have a regular
janitor to look after the furnace, and sweep
out, as well as keep the windows clean.</p>

<p>Temporary positions were found for two more
in the restaurant next door, and it seemed as if
Mr. Holwell might prove himself equal to every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
emergency that could arise, for he never allowed
anything to daunt him.</p>

<p>From the beginning the new movement appeared
to meet with success. It was quite noticeable
how few boys were to be seen loitering on the
streets since the Junior Department had come into
existence. The Chief of Police admitted that
complaints of practical pranks being played upon
citizens of the town, or farmers living nearby,
were getting to be a rare occurrence.</p>

<p>Of course, Mr. Holwell was greatly pleased
with the measure of success that seemed to have
already followed his attempt to better conditions
in Cliffwood. He knew, however, that there must
be no slackening of the good work, or things would
begin to go down hill again; for there was an invisible
pulling against the new order of things,
which might come from the lower elements of the
town.</p>

<p>Every night as many as a score of boys could
be seen either reading books or the latest magazines
or engaged in playing dominoes, checkers or
chess in the comfortable rooms of the Y. M. C. A.
building.</p>

<p>Then there was a weekly lecture to which they
were usually invited, if the subject happened to
be of a nature suitable to their years. The swimming
pool had also been completed, and the
younger members of the association had the privilege<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
of using this on certain afternoons when one
of the older boys could be on hand to keep order.
He had also to see that no fellow took any chances
of catching cold, to avoid which the shower was
always required after coming out of the warmer
water.</p>

<p>Down in the gymnasium they had splendid times
when allowed to enjoy themselves, and many a
boy began to show cheeks of a ruddier hue on account
of the work done there under the eye of a
competent instructor.</p>

<p>Not only this, but several boys who had until
then rejected the friendly advances of Mr. Holwell
were influenced to enter their names on the
roll, when they learned what glorious times those
who already belonged were having. This was
just what the big-hearted minister wanted. He
felt positive that they would soon change their
ways, after getting to know him better.</p>

<p>Indeed, everything seemed to be working along
famously. Even Nat and Dit had concluded that
they would be silly to deny themselves the splendid
privileges afforded by the Y. M. C. A. building
when they could be obtained by a simple little
written apology.</p>

<p>So one day Mr. Holwell was surprised, and
pleased as well, no doubt, to receive a letter by
mail, signed by Nat Silmore, Dit Hennesy and
Alonzo Crane, in which the trio declared they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
were truly sorry they had annoyed the good man
on that former occasion. They promised that if
he would forgive them, and allow them to send
in their names, they would surely obey the rules of
the association.</p>

<p>Perhaps even Mr. Holwell may have had serious
doubts as to the genuine nature of their reformation.
He must have guessed that the main
thing with Nat was to be able to enjoy the various
pleasant gatherings afforded by the new association.
But Mr. Holwell was always ready to give
a fellow another chance, and he hastened to seek
an interview with each of the three obstreperous
signers of the “apology.”</p>

<p>It ended in their being admitted to membership
in the Boys’ Department, much to the chagrin of
some of the older members, who among themselves
prophesied all sorts of dire disasters as
the inevitable result.</p>

<p>“They’re just coming in so as to upset things,”
declared Dan Fenwick to several of his best
friends when they found Nat and the other two
having the time of their lives on the parallel bars
one evening, and grinning openly at each fresh arrival
as if to say tauntingly: “Thought you’d keep
us out, didn’t you? But you’ve got another guess
coming, see!”</p>

<p>Harry Bartlett did not fully share in the hopes
of Mr. Holwell regarding the possible “turning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
over of a new leaf” on the part of Nat. He knew
the youth to be “a tough case,” and believed that
when he had exhausted the pleasures of the new
order of things, they would hear from him again
in the shape of some of his notorious tricks.</p>

<p>So the leader of the Y. M. C. A. made up his
mind to say nothing, but to keep his eye closely on
Nat. And he was firmly resolved that at the first
sign of trouble the unruly fellow should be shown
the door.</p>

<p>Dick was already busily engaged on his farce.
The rules of the game had been laid down plainly
by Mr. Holwell at the last weekly meeting.</p>

<p>“Every member in good standing of the Boys’
Department is entitled to a chance to win the
prize,” he had told them. “The farce is to be not
only wholly original, even to the jokes, words of
songs and choruses, but it must be clean, and entirely
unobjectionable. Nothing that could offend
your mothers and sisters will be tolerated for a
minute. It is intended for at least eight principals
to take separate parts, and the copy must be
handed in two weeks from today, so we can practice
before the Christmas holidays.”</p>

<p>When some of the eager boys who meant to
try for the rich prize evinced a strong desire for
more information, Mr. Holwell continued his remarks.</p>

<p>“The committee will read every farce submitted,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
and if there are two that seem to be of about
equal merit the mayor of Cliffwood has kindly consented
to act as umpire so as to decide which is the
better. I have also agreed to serve as adviser to
the committee; and I want it to be known that no
favorites will be played.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” cried the listening boys, though every
one knew full well even before Mr. Holwell
said this that the awarding of the golden prize
would be done fairly, because he was a square man.</p>

<p>“Every tub will have to stand on its own bottom,
you understand,” continued the minister,
looking down into the faces of the score and more
of boys occupying seats in front of him. “And
may the best fellow win is the wish of not only myself,
but the committee, and every one interested
in this work.”</p>

<p>To the astonishment, and amusement as well, of
some of the boys, Nat Silmore, the night he joined,
openly announced his intention of competing for
the prize.</p>

<p>“Grin all you want to,” he told some of the boys
who had gathered near him later in that evening
when he and his cronies had become members of
the Junior League; “but all the same I’ve got a
hunch you’ll laugh on the other side of your mouths
when you find out how easy I’m goin’ to run away
with that yellow stuff.”</p>

<p>“But you never were much of a success at school<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
in composition, you know, Nat,” remarked Phil
Harkness. “So what makes you think you can
beat the rest of us, with one hand tied down?”</p>

<p>Nat winked knowingly as he answered this question.</p>

<p>“Oh! mebbe I’ve been practicin’ on the sly all
this time,” he told them with a nod of his head.
“P’raps I discovered I had a reg’lar gift ’long the
line of makin’ up jokes and crackin’ lively puns.
Huh! you just wait and see what happens. I’m
just gettin’ to find myself, I reckon. Some of
these days you’ll see folks take off their hats when
they speak of Nat Silmore, the celebrated author!”</p>

<p>It was hard to know just what Nat meant when
he talked like this. Even Mr. Holwell might have
been deceived by his apparent earnestness, indulging
in the hope that the bully of Cliffwood had
actually begun to see a light, and realized it paid
to be decent after all.</p>

<p>As for the boys, they were all at sea, and the
subject often came up when two or three of them
got together to talk things over.</p>

<p>“It’ll pay to keep your eye on Nat,” was the
sage comment of Dan Fenwick that same evening,
when they were getting ready to go home. “He’s
got something going in that shrewd brain of his,
I take it. He’ll surprise us by springing a prank,
or else by actually copping that prize.”</p>

<p>“Wake me up when he does that last,” laughed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
Leslie. “He’ll play second fiddle to a lot of us
besides Dick, who have set out to have a fling for
the money.”</p>

<p>Dick himself did not feel at all uneasy. He was
coming along finely with his farce, and already began
to entertain high hopes that it would land the
prize. As Leslie was himself laboring with considerable
vim to compose a similar effort, of course
Dick could not read any of his work to his best
chum, so he took it out on his folks at home, all
of whom declared that it was “just splendid.”</p>

<p>As usual the two boys walked home together.</p>

<p>“One good thing I can see about Nat joining
the club,” ventured Leslie, as they sauntered along
leisurely, “is the fact that for the time being it
may keep him out of mischief. For instance, here
we are taking it easy going home, without any fear
of being suddenly pelted with a shower of rocks,
or having some trick played on us.”</p>

<p>“I hope that Mr. Holwell won’t be disappointed,”
ventured Dick, who was very fond of the
minister, as were most of the boys; “because I
can see he is beginning to believe Nat’s changing
his ways. Some of us boys would like to see that
same thing, but we’ll only believe it when he’s
proved himself sincere.”</p>

<p>“And Dick, I don’t believe Nat’s forgiven us
for the way we upset his little game on the night
he waylaid us,” continued Leslie. “You remember<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
both Nat and Dit did have a black eye apiece
the next day, though they claimed to have gotten
them by running against something in the dark.
We knew what it was they struck; and most of the
other fellows did too.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I saw him looking pretty hard at me more
than once,” admitted Dick, “and could give a good
guess what he was thinking he’d like to do while I
was hanging head-down from the trapeze. But
both of us will always be careful whenever Nat’s
in the gymnasium.”</p>

<p>“How about our scheme, Dick?” continued Leslie.
“You keep on telling me that hardly a day
passes without little Billy wandering over into
Old Jed Nocker’s yard and meeting the deacon.
By this time it strikes me the crabbed old man must
have begun to get pretty much interested in our
Billy.”</p>

<p>“Oh! he certainly is,” came the prompt reply,
“and has even been questioning the little chap
about his mother, whom he knows simply as the
Widow Smith, and has only glimpsed through the
trees as she walked about the Brandon grounds.”</p>

<p>“Then you’ll be wanting to spring the trap before
a great while, I reckon?” pursued Leslie,
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Better wait until we’re sure he’s fallen head
over heels into the pit,” urged Dick. “The
weather has been mighty fine for November.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
There was one day though when Billy was kept in
because he was a little off his feed, and would you
believe it, along about four in the afternoon there
came over to the Brandon place the man servant
Mr. Nocker has, fetching a polite little note asking
the mother to assure him that the dear child
was all right, as he had missed him very much.”</p>

<p>“Fine, Dick!” exclaimed Leslie. “I’d like to see
them together if it could be arranged.”</p>

<p>“You shall, and tomorrow at that,” replied
Dick. “We’ll go together and hide in the bushes
while little Billy wanders through the hole in the
fence.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br>

<small>HOW THE PLAN WORKED</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">According</span> to agreement, Leslie waylaid Dick
on the following morning as the latter was hurrying
homeward.</p>

<p>“How about that little arrangement of ours,
Dick?” he demanded, as he locked arms with his
chum and kept pace with the other’s long strides.</p>

<p>“Guess it goes through all right,” Dick replied,
smilingly; “if you mean our plan to lie low, and
watch the meeting between Billy and his grandfather.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t too late for it, I hope,” ventured Leslie,
anxiously.</p>

<p>“Oh! no,” came the confident reply; “I saw
Billy’s mother this morning, and she promised not
to let him out this afternoon till I gave the high
sign.”</p>

<p>“And what was that to be?” continued the other.</p>

<p>“When we get to the corner of the fence where
you can see the windows of the old Brandon house,
I’m to wave my handkerchief. She’s to be looking,
or have Billy do the same, and after I get an answer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
to my signal we’ll just have time to creep up
to where the old deacon is waiting to have his daily
chat with the child.”</p>

<p>“You certainly have it all cooked up as neat as
anything, Dick,” declared Leslie, admiringly, for
he considered that his chum was without a rival
when it came down to arranging things.</p>

<p>They hurried on until finally the fence corner
was reached from which a good view of the Brandon
house could be obtained.</p>

<p>“Now watch me,” Dick remarked, as he commenced
to wave his pocket handkerchief slowly to
and fro.</p>

<p>“There, I can see some one moving at that upper
window!” exclaimed Leslie.</p>

<p>“I reckon it must be Billy,” said Dick, still keeping
up the signalling.</p>

<p>“They see you, Dick, and now some one has
commenced to answer. The scheme worked like
magic. All we have to do is to go and get into
the deacon’s grounds.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got that part of it all fixed too,” asserted
Dick. “Billy isn’t to start out for five minutes
after they get my signal. By that time we ought to
be creeping up pretty close to Mr. Nocker.”</p>

<p>“How do you know he’ll be waiting there?”
whispered Leslie, as both of them started to climb
the fence.</p>

<p>“I don’t know it, but the chances are ten to one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
we’ll find him walking up and down as nervous as
anything, and keeping his eyes fixed on the path
Billy usually comes along.”</p>

<p>Once in the Brandon grounds, it was easy
enough for them to find the very spot where, on
that never-to-be-forgotten Hallowe’en night, the
prank-loving crowd had slipped through a gap in
the dividing fence.</p>

<p>“You see it’s never been mended,” whispered
Dick exultantly. “Of course, the old deacon
knows this break is here, but he wouldn’t allow it
to be closed for a good deal, because that would
stop Billy’s daily visits.”</p>

<p>Creeping through the opening, they began to
make a little detour. The object of this move was
plain to Leslie, for he understood that if the stern
old man chanced to be watching eagerly for the
coming of his new little acquaintance, his eyes
would be searching the path leading from the
break in the fence.</p>

<p>Dick had all this “laid out to a fraction,” as
Leslie would have said; and in a short time they
could discover a moving figure under the trees.</p>

<p>“Told you so,” whispered Dick, under his
breath, as he gave his companion a nudge in the
ribs, and carefully pointed ahead.</p>

<p>Just as Dick had figured it was old Deacon
Nocker who was walking to and fro in his usual
nervous fashion. Every now and then he would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
stop, shade his eyes with one hand, and gaze long
and earnestly beyond.</p>

<p>He was evidently wondering whether anything
could have happened to the child, for, as a rule,
Billy trotted over to visit him long before this time
of the afternoon. And really the storekeeper must
have left his place of business early in order to enjoy
this, to him, novel treat.</p>

<p>Led by Dick, who knew how to creep along after
the manner of an Indian, Leslie presently found
himself close enough to the impatient deacon to
hear him muttering discontentedly to himself. It
thrilled them both to catch the disjointed sentences,
for by this they knew that already the chubby
little Billy had managed to worm himself into a
corner of the sour old man’s long closed heart.</p>

<p>Another nudge from Dick’s elbow caused Leslie
to catch his breath, for he knew that it meant
the child was coming. No danger of Mr. Nocker
discovering the pair of eavesdroppers in the bushes
close by, for all his attention was taken up with
straining his eyes in the opposite quarter.</p>

<p>The boys could see a sturdy little figure brushing
through the bushes. Billy was hurrying to
keep his appointment, for evidently he had come
to rather enjoy meeting the elderly gentleman,
who always had some little present for him.</p>

<p class="caption">THE DEACON STOOPED DOWN AND ENCLOSED LITTLE BILLY
IN HIS ARMS.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Mr. Nocker was heard to give utterance to an
exclamation of exultation as he caught sight of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
lad. He even hurried forward a few paces in order
to meet him.</p>

<p>When the two who were in hiding saw the deacon
stoop down and actually enclose little Billy in
his arms, straining him to his heart, they were
thrilled. Nobody in all Cliffwood had ever before
known the cold old deacon to exhibit the least bit
of tenderness toward any child.</p>

<p>“What kept you so long, Billy boy?” demanded
the deacon, reproachfully. “Why, do you know
I have been waiting here almost half an hour? I
began to think my little playmate had been taken
sick again.”</p>

<p>“Mamma kept me in,” said the little fellow in
his clear voice that easily reached the strained ears
of the two in the bushes. “But I teased and teased
and then when she saw <i>it</i> she just said she guessed
she’d <i>have</i> to let me come out.”</p>

<p>The deacon looked at him in a puzzled fashion;
but evidently he was so well satisfied to have Billy
with him, even for a brief time, that he did not
think it worth while to ask questions.</p>

<p>Of course, the two listening boys knew what the
child meant, since it was Dick’s waving handkerchief
that the young widow had seen.</p>

<p>“Mamma told me I could only stay five minutes
over here,” continued Billy, who seemed to be an
unusually bright little fellow, able to express his
thoughts in a sensible manner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>“Oh! naughty mamma, to cut your visit short
like that,” complained the deacon. “She must know
I enjoy every minute of it so, and she has you the
whole of the day and night. But come and sit
down with me here while you do stay, Billy.”</p>

<p>He uttered the name almost caressingly. Dick
was silently chuckling over the astonishing success
of the scheme he had originated. He realized that
matters had by this time reached a stage that insured
success sooner or later.</p>

<p>Mr. Nocker held one of the boy’s diminutive
hands in his, and led him to a bench which looked
very new. Undoubtedly, it had been placed there
recently by the special orders of the owner of the
place, so that he and the child could sit and chat
during the brief visit Billy was allowed to pay him
each day.</p>

<p>“Some time, Billy,” he was saying, “I must meet
your mother. She has been very kind to let you
visit a lonely old man like me every day. I am
sure she must be a very nice little lady, though I
have only seen her at a distance.”</p>

<p>Another fierce nudge from Dick’s elbow and directed
in the region of Leslie’s side announced
how pleased the other was on hearing this confession.</p>

<p>“My mamma is an angel,” they heard Billy
stoutly assert. “The nicest mamma in all the
world. And I always tell her how good you are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
to me. She said some time she hoped to thank
you herself, sir.”</p>

<p>“And she shall, Billy, she shall,” declared the
deacon, smiling grimly, and evidently enjoying a
new sensation.</p>

<p>Finally the clock in the church tower in town
struck the hour. Billy immediately jumped from
his seat on the bench.</p>

<p>“Oh! my mamma made me promise to come
back when the clock struck, so I must be going.”</p>

<p>“I’ll walk as far as the fence with you then,
Billy,” said Mr. Nocker, looking quite forlorn.
“Try and get your mother’s consent to stay longer
tomorrow, please.”</p>

<p>“I will, sir,” replied the little fellow, promptly;
“because I like to be over here with you.”</p>

<p>At that the old man bent hastily down and drew
Billy into his arms. The watching boys saw him
kiss the little chap several times.</p>

<p>“Here is a present for you, Billy,” said the
deacon, “but don’t open the package until you are
back with your good mother. Tell her that before
long I hope to call on her myself.”</p>

<p>Together they walked toward the gap in the division
fence. Dick and Leslie changed their position,
thinking to make a safe retreat presently.
They stopped only long enough to see the stern
deacon standing at the fence blowing kisses after
little Billy.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br>

<small>THE MAN WHO DID NOT KNOW BOYS</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Shake</span> hands on it, Dick,” said Leslie;
“you’ve got the old curmudgeon to swallow the
bait all right, and he’s hooked as fast as anything.
All you need to do now is to pull the line in and
land him.”</p>

<p>“Do you think so, Leslie?” mused the other.
“Well, I’m glad for the sake of little Billy and his
mother, for she has a mighty small amount of
money to live on, and the deacon is a rich man,
you know.”</p>

<p>“What do you reckon he’s thinking about while
he stands there with his arms on the fence, and his
head bowed on them?” asked Leslie, as they were
making their way silently toward the street, intending
to clamber over the front fence at a point
where they could not be seen.</p>

<p>“I don’t know for sure,” replied the other, “but
I should think it might be about his own boy,
Amos. Mebbe he looked a little like Billy does
now, when he was small. And how can we tell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
but what memory has got busy in that scheming
old brain of the deacon’s?”</p>

<p>“Well,” observed Leslie, as they reached the
street safely, after vaulting the fence boy-style,
“I could see him looking into the face of the youngster
now and then, and rubbing his own forehead
as if he might be puzzled to know where he ever
could have seen Billy before.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” assented Dick, quickly; “you remember
he asked Billy once if he had ever lived
in Cliffwood before, and the boy said not that he
knew of. Well, it seems to be working finely, and
I guess after all little Mrs. Nocker won’t have to
work to keep the wolf from the door.”</p>

<p>“Not with the grip Billy has got on his old
grandfather’s heart,” laughed Leslie. “I never
would have believed any child could wind that
cold-blooded storekeeper around his little finger.
It’s as good as pie to me to see it.”</p>

<p>They headed into town, talking as they went,
and, of course, there were many matters to be discussed
between them, besides Dick’s latest scheme.</p>

<p>“There’s Mr. Holwell,” remarked Dick, suddenly;
“and since he knows so much about my plan
I think I’d like to tell him what we’ve just been
watching.”</p>

<p>“A good idea too, Dick,” assented the other.</p>

<p>The minister met them with one of his customary
pleasant smiles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>“You both look as if something unusually fine
had happened this afternoon,” he remarked.
“Perhaps you wouldn’t object to telling me about
the same.”</p>

<p>“That’s just what we meant to do, sir,” declared
Dick. “It’s about Deacon Nocker and little
Billy, you see.”</p>

<p>Mr. Holwell immediately showed the most intense
interest.</p>

<p>“Then that clever plan of yours must be working
out in a satisfactory manner, Dick, my lad,”
he remarked, “if I can judge from the happy expression
on your face just now.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, I reckon it’s going to be a bully success,
sir!” ventured Leslie.</p>

<p>“We’ve just been watching one of their meetings,”
Dick continued, “and it’s plain to be seen,
sir, that Billy has got a firm grip on Mr. Nocker’s
heart. We saw the deacon kiss him lots of times,
and squeeze him just as if he wanted to eat him.
Oh, it’s bound to come out all right in the end.”</p>

<p>“Good for you, Dick!” said the minister, enthusiastically,
taking the hand of the boy in his
strong grip; “and I want to say that I consider
you’ve played one of the neatest games that could
be devised.”</p>

<p>As the two chums walked onward, Dick’s face
was beaming with happiness. There had been
a time when he would have cared little for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
good opinion of Mr. Holwell, but somehow, of
late a great change seemed to have come over the
wayward boy’s nature. Many things that he had
formerly delighted in, no longer held an attraction
for him; and every day he was awakening to the
fact that service for others could bring more real
pleasure than selfish gratification ever did.</p>

<p>“Here’s trouble with a big T!” burst out Leslie
before they had gone far.</p>

<p>“You mean about Dan Fenwick, I suppose,”
ventured Dick, glancing at an approaching figure.
“Sure enough, he does look pretty sour, as if his
dinner hadn’t agreed with him any too well.”</p>

<p>Dan came along shaking his head, and frowning
savagely.</p>

<p>“What’s got you this time, Dan?” burst out Leslie
as they joined forces. “Lost that new knife
you got on your last birthday? Or mebbe now
Susie Banks has promised another fellow she’d
go with him to that barn dance they’re getting up
for Christmas Eve?”</p>

<p>At that Dan shook his head and grinned, showing
he had not yet reached such a depth of actual
woe.</p>

<p>“Huh! ’tisn’t <i>quite</i> so bad as all that, fellows,”
he went on to explain. “But let me tell you something
has got to be done about that Mr. Loft.
He’s gettin’ on my nerves, and that’s a fact.”</p>

<p>Dick and Leslie exchanged glances at hearing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
this fresh complaint about the pedantic librarian
who seemed to think boys ought to be fed on
heavy stuff from the time they were able to read
their primers.</p>

<p>“Been knocking you again, has he, Dan?” demanded
Leslie, frowning.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s getting so bad now,” said the other,
angrily, “that a boy can’t ask for a single work of
fiction but what Mr. Loft takes occasion to give
him a long lecture on wasted opportunities. He
says we ought to be cramming intelligence into our
brains instead of fooling away our time with such
trash as we ask for.”</p>

<p>“He makes me tired,” asserted Leslie. “To his
mind everything a boy does that isn’t meant to fill
his poor brain with knowledge is wasted. If he
had his way I bet you there wouldn’t be a real
boy’s book in all the library; and some of them are
standard works at that.”</p>

<p>“My father and grandfather read Robinson
Crusoe, Swiss Family Robinson, and a lot of other
books that every boy with red blood in his veins
dotes on,” asserted Dan. “But Mr. Loft told me
they ought to be burnt, and that he meant to see
if he could influence the town council to allow him
to weed out all such pernicious juvenile literature.”</p>

<p>“Then never a boy will be seen in our fine library,
you can be sure of that!” asserted Dick,
pugnaciously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>“I’ve talked it over with several people besides
my folks,” Leslie went on to tell his chums, “and
they all think this way. Like Mr. Holwell, they
admit that there are lots of books for boys published
these days at a cheap price that are written
just for the excitement in them. They condemn
that class, but at the same time say there are many
volumes, and some of ’em cheap at that, that while
full of adventure, show a boy how to curb his
faults, and climb up the ladder of fame.”</p>

<p>“I could string off two dozen titles right now,
every one a dandy book,” asserted Dan, pugnaciously,
“all on my shelf at home, and my mother
has read every single one of the same. What <i>she</i>
says is all right you can depend on isn’t going to
do a fellow any harm, for she used to be a teacher
in New York City, and knows boys from the
ground up.”</p>

<p>“There’s only one thing to be done about it,”
asserted Dick. “That is to start a library of our
own as we talked about some time ago.”</p>

<p>“You mean inside the Y. M. C. A.?” asked
Dan, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Yes, after we consult again with Mr. Holwell
about it,” came the answer, showing that Dick
had been thinking over the idea since the time it
was first mentioned.</p>

<p>“Each member of the club might contribute
what books he cared to spare,” Leslie continued.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
“I’ve got a whole pile I’d like to offer for my
share. Mr. Holwell could be the judge of what
was fit for us to have in our library. He knows
boys ten times better than that high-brow Mr.
Loft.”</p>

<p>All of them displayed signs of great enthusiasm
over the idea. The boys of Cliffwood had long
suffered at the hands of the town librarian, who,
though doubtless a worthy as well as a learned
man, had never learned to peep into the heart of
a genuine boy, and know how to handle him so as
to cultivate the best there was in him.</p>

<p>“It’ll sure be a big feather in our cap if we do
manage to have a library of our own, every book
carefully selected, and just the kind we love to
read as well,” Dan hastened to say, the sour look
now gone entirely from his face.</p>

<p>“And for my part,” Leslie went on to say, “I’m
going to get Uncle Henry interested in the scheme.
I really believe he’ll put up the money to buy a lot
of books of the right sort—that are of an uplifting
character, besides being full of stirring adventure.”</p>

<p>“I’m mighty glad now Mr. Loft lectured me
as he did,” said Dan; “because you see it’s
brought matters to a head right away. Whee!
but won’t he lift his hands in horror when he hears
about it. I can just see the look on his face.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br>

<small>MET ON THE HIGHWAY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Upon</span> reaching home that afternoon Dick found
that his mother had an errand she wanted him
to do. This was to take his old wheel and ride
out a mile or so into the country, to get some fresh
eggs that had been promised by the wife of a farmer.</p>

<p>“And be very careful, Dick,” she cautioned
him as he was ready for the start. “Don’t try any
fast riding while you are carrying my precious
eggs, for once they are scrambled nothing can
undo the damage.”</p>

<p>The boy laughed merrily at the picture she
drew.</p>

<p>“I promise you I’ll go carefully enough,
Mother,” he told her. “Luckily enough I’ve just
fixed the old tire of my wheel so I think it’ll hold
out. If it breaks loose again why I’ll hoof it home
rather than take any chances.”</p>

<p>“Tell Mrs. Brown to pack the eggs in sawdust
as she did the last ones, and the chances of
their breaking will be small,” were the last words<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
Mrs. Horner called out after him as he jumped
into his saddle and rode away.</p>

<p>Dick was very proud of his little mother, and
of late she had been made happy in noticing what
a great change had come over her boy. He had
always been considerate of her comfort, but at the
same time frequently caused her gentle heart to
bleed through the tricks he so dearly loved to play.
But all that seemed to have undergone a great
change since he had joined the Boys’ Department
of the Y. M. C. A.</p>

<p>Dick managed to reach the Brown farm without
a puncture, though he more than half expected
one at any moment. The eggs were duly packed
in his basket, and the farmer’s wife saw to it that
the messenger had a slice of gingerbread as well
as a glass of cold milk while he sat a few minutes
and watched her place the fragile eggs in the sawdust.</p>

<p>“I guess I’ll take the other road home,” Dick
told himself, as he trundled his rather dilapidated
wheel out through the gateway on to the road.</p>

<p>It was but an idle fancy, because every road
for many miles around Cliffwood was as familiar
to Dick as the commons in the center of the town.
At the time he could not guess that even this little
change of plan was fated to be fraught with consequences
that were bound to have a decided influence
on his life; yet such proved to be the case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>Hardly had the boy gone three hundred feet
from the gate of the Brown farm when he had
the expected puncture. The tires on his wheel had
been mended so often that they could never be depended
on; and Dick found it hard work earning
enough money to buy himself a new pair at the
sporting goods store in town.</p>

<p>“Just my luck to have it hit the rear wheel,” he
remarked, as he jumped down, not forgetting to
be exceedingly careful how he handled that precious
basket of new-laid eggs.</p>

<p>As he could not very well ride on the rim the
rest of the way home there was only one thing
left to do, which was to trudge along on foot. Dick
was rather a philosophical boy, and could accept a
bad turn without showing very much chagrin. So
whistling some school air he walked sturdily onward.</p>

<p>Less than ten minutes later, while near the outskirts
of the town, he came upon a tramp, as he
believed, sitting under a tree. At least the man
seemed poorly dressed, and his beard was gray,
and Dick imagined he looked wan and hungry, as
if he might have been recently sick.</p>

<p>The man stopped Dick as he was passing, after
nodding cheerfully. Perhaps something in the
frank look of the boy’s face attracted him.</p>

<p>“This town is Cliffwood, isn’t it, lad?” he
asked; and somehow the tone of his voice pleased<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
Dick, and he turned and came back to where the
old man was seated.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s Cliffwood,” he replied. “Is there
any one you want to find in the town?”</p>

<p>The man was staring very hard at him all the
while.</p>

<p>“Might I ask your name, boy?” he inquired, not
insolently, Dick thought, but as if for some reason
he really wanted to know.</p>

<p>“I’m Dick Horner,” the boy frankly told him.
“I live with my grandfather and my mother on the
outskirts of Cliffwood. Grandfather Horner is
an army veteran, you see, and everybody around
here knows him, I guess.”</p>

<p>He wondered why the tramp should start and
look at him more keenly than ever, at the same
time mumble something to himself.</p>

<p>“Now, I’m of the opinion,” the old man went on
to say, presently, “that the mother of such a fine
lad as you must have a gentle heart.”</p>

<p>Dick fell into the trap headlong. If any one
ever wished to win his good opinion there was no
shorter road to success than through praise of his
little mother.</p>

<p>“She’s the best mother in the whole country, and
that’s right!” he declared in his boyish way.</p>

<p>“Do you think, lad, she would give me a bite
to eat if I walked along with you?” continued the
trampish looking stranger, eagerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>Dick drew a long breath. It suddenly dawned
on him that perhaps the other had been working
matters to suit some hidden purpose of his own.
Still, Dick stuck to his guns; he had never known
his gentle mother to turn a poor tramp away from
her door if she really believed him to be hungry,
and ready to do some slight service in return for
being fed.</p>

<p>“All right!” Dick declared, on the spur of the
moment. “You just come along with me, and I
guess my mother will be able to give you a sandwich
anyhow. I hope you can walk, though at that
it’s only a little way off.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been pretty sick lately,” said the other,
shaking his head. “Fact is one time I thought I
was going to cash my checks in, and it spurred me
to doing something I’d long been figuring on.
Thank you, my boy, for your kindness to a total
stranger. The bread cast upon the waters may
return again before many days.”</p>

<p>Now Leslie, being of a more suspicious nature
than his chum, Dick, might have suspected that the
stranger was simply taking advantage of the boy’s
good nature to impose on him. Dick, as he walked
along, the other hobbling painfully at his side,
even offered to relieve the tramp of his shabby little
bundle.</p>

<p>“You see, I can lay it on the saddle of my wheel,
and alongside the basket of eggs I’ve been getting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
at a farm house,” he explained; and the man
looked keenly at him, though Dick did not suspect
this fact, wagging his beard as though somehow
this thoughtful consideration for his age and infirmities
touched his heart.</p>

<p>They soon came to the little Horner home. It
was a neat cottage close to the bank of the Sweetbriar
River. Indeed, when the wind set from upstream
one could plainly hear the murmur of the
fretful waters at the place where they formed the
rough rapids that gave the several mills their
water power.</p>

<p>Grandpop Horner was sitting in the light of the
dying sun, because the day had been quite mild
for the late season, and he loved the sunshine very
much. As Dick and the trampish looking old fellow
came through the gate, Mrs. Horner issued
from the doorway of the cottage to urge upon the
old veteran the necessity for coming in before the
chill of approaching evening affected his rheumatic
limb.</p>

<p>Dick saw the look of wonder on both their faces
as he led his strange companion up the walk to the
front porch.</p>

<p>“Mother,” he started to explain, now half
afraid that possibly he had done the wrong thing
in bringing a total stranger home with him, and
at that one who rather looked as though he might
be sick and penniless, “this is a poor man I met<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
on the road. He is hungry, and has been sick.
I told him I believed you would not refuse him a
bite to eat; and that perhaps he could sleep in the
hay in our little barn.”</p>

<p>The mother looked a little worried. Then she
smiled as though on second thought she could not
find it in her heart to refuse to help any one in
distress, even though food was never too plentiful
at the Horner home.</p>

<p>“Why, certainly, my boy. We can find something
to satisfy his appetite; and if you think best
he shall pass the night in our barn.”</p>

<p>The stranger started to speak as though trying
to express his gratitude. Something, however,
stopped him; perhaps he choked, for he coughed
severely several times, so that Mrs. Horner became
visibly anxious.</p>

<p>“You have indeed been sick, my poor man,”
she hastened to say. “Come directly into the house
and get warm. What you need is a cup of hot
coffee, and something to eat. Dick, you did the
right thing to bring him home with you.”</p>

<p>Even Grandfather Horner, who had been shaking
his head while this was going on, seemed to
be ready to echo the kind words of Dick’s mother.</p>

<p>“Only one who has been a soldier for four long
years, and endured the pangs of hunger many
times, knows what it is to want,” he declared earnestly.
“When I escaped from Libby Prison I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
spent six weeks in the swamps, being hunted like
a dog; and I had to live on nuts and roots and berries
most of the time, except when some slave managed
to give me a sheaf of cornbread. Nobody
ever passes the Horner home hungry as long as
we have a bit to spare.”</p>

<p>The stranger was visibly shaken with emotion.
He started toward Mrs. Horner and held out
both his trembling hands.</p>

<p>“Polly, don’t you know me?” he demanded, at
which remark Dick’s mother bent forward, stared
closely into his seamed face, and then almost
shrieked:</p>

<p>“Oh! it’s my older brother Silas, whom we believed
died years ago in Alaska!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br>

<small>LESLIE ON GUARD</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Leslie Capes</span>, coming around the corner of the
house just then, gaped in sheer amazement at the
remarkable picture before him. And when he saw
Dick’s sweet little mother, after giving vent to
those words, embrace the shabby looking stranger
as though she at least had no doubt concerning his
identity, Leslie shook his head in his suspicious
way.</p>

<p>“It may be all right,” he muttered to himself,
“but that old rascal looks like an impostor to me.
How can Mrs. Horner tell whether it’s her brother
or not, when she hasn’t seen him for so many
years?”</p>

<p>He determined then and there to constitute himself
a vigilance committee of one to watch the
stranger closely. If he detected anything that
looked suspicious it would of course be his duty to
tell his chum, and so put the Horners on their
guard.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the others were so excited that none
of them even noticed the presence of Leslie Capes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
so that he had plenty of chances to listen and observe.</p>

<p>“For years,” the wanderer was saying, with a
touch of regret in his voice, “I’ve been promising
myself to look up my only sister if I could strike
it rich. Fortune plays queer pranks with men up
there in Alaska. Several times I believed I was
on the verge of a glorious fortune, only to have the
bubble burst.”</p>

<p>He uttered the last words with a half groan as
though nearly overpowered.</p>

<p>“Never mind, Silas,” said Mrs. Horner, as
cheerily as she could, “your intentions were good
at least. It was not your fault if fortune failed to
knock at your door. But how did you find us out?”</p>

<p>The shabby stranger swallowed hard as though
nearly overcome with emotion; but the watchful
Leslie believed this was mostly assumed. He was
more than ever convinced that the so-called Silas
would bear close scrutiny.</p>

<p>“When I finally fell sick,” continued the weary
wanderer, “somehow my thoughts seemed to roam
back to the old life more than ever. Finally, I
could stand it no longer, and determined to start
out in hopes of finding my little sister Polly. I
had enough to take me to the States, and East. By
following up certain clues, I learned that you were
living in this section, and I came here to see you
once more before I cashed in.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>“But you have been walking far today, Silas,
and you look half dead with fatigue,” Dick’s gentle
mother went on to say. “Indeed, you must
rest here for a few days until you can plan for
your future. Oh! I wish we were better off, so
that I could offer you a home for the rest of your
life!”</p>

<p>“That would be an imposition, Polly, which I
could not hear of,” said the other, though Leslie
noticed that when he turned his head aside, he
smiled as though secretly pleased. “If I can rest
a day or two, I intend to go on to New York City,
where an old partner of mine lives.”</p>

<p>“But would he do anything for you, Silas?”
asked Mrs. Horner, solicitously.</p>

<p>“I saved his life once in the gold mines up there
in the frozen North,” explained Silas, quickly.
“And as he has made his pile, I fancy Joe Shepard
wouldn’t begrudge me the little money needed to
keep my soul and body together for the short time
I have to live.”</p>

<p>Now Leslie had been noticing that in spite of the
cough which Silas gave vent to at times, and his
bent attitude, he had rather a sturdy figure.</p>

<p>“Sure that old fellow is putting it on pretty thick
for some reason or other,” the boy kept telling
himself. “I even believe that cough of his is made
up, because he lets it go every once in a while, as if
he suddenly remembers a plan he has figured out.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
Huh! he may pull the wool over the eyes of these
simple Horners, but I’ve got my eye on him, you
bet. I’ll lay low and watch the sly old fox.”</p>

<p>Grandpop Horner again entered into the conversation
at this point. He pounded his cane vigorously
on the floor to emphasize his remarks, in
a way he had.</p>

<p>“Don’t think of it, my boy,” he said, heartily.
“No brother of my daughter-in-law, Polly Horner,
is going to beg his way while we’ve got a crust in
the larder. You’ll hang your hat on a peg in this
house, and be welcome to what little we’ve got.”</p>

<p>“Oh! that’s too much, sir, entirely too much,”
remonstrated the other, shaken by some emotion.
“But I am tempted to stay with you a day or two
until I get a little strength back. Then I can shape
my plans, and will perhaps have heard from my
old partner in the city. He may send me the
money to come to him.”</p>

<p>“Polly, put the kettle on!” sang Grandpop Horner,
in his cheery way, “and we will have our tea.
The fare is plain, Silas, but so far we have not
known real want, though there are many things we
have to do without, and my pension doesn’t go as
far as I would like.”</p>

<p>The newcomer sat there looking quite happy,
Leslie Capes thought as he watched his chum Dick
bustling around, bringing in several armfuls of
wood, and assisting his mother in various ways.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>Now ordinarily, Leslie, being a most accommodating
fellow, would have hastened to lend Dick
a helping hand. On this special occasion he did
nothing of the sort, and for a very good reason.</p>

<p>“I’ve just <i>got</i> to play detective,” he told himself
in explanation for his peculiar conduct, “and
keep an eye on that smart stranger. I don’t believe
more than half he says. He knows something
about Silas Langhorne, who was mebbe a pal of
his up in Alaska, and is bent on imposing on these
simple people. But p’raps he’ll run up against a
snag when he finds he’s got Leslie Capes to contend
with.”</p>

<p>Old Grandpop Horner entertained the wanderer
while these preparations for supper were
under way. Of course, most of his talk ran along
the lines of his extraordinary adventures in the
long-ago, when he fought through the Civil War.
Indeed, no matter what line the conversation
opened with, it was sure to drift to those times that
had been stamped so indelibly on the old veteran’s
mind.</p>

<p>Dick presently found that his mother needed
him no longer and so joined his chum, who was
playing with little Sue, some seven years of age, a
winsome girl with chestnut curls, and a slight lisp
that made her more attractive than otherwise
might have been the case.</p>

<p>Even Grandpop had his duties to perform, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
was set to work grinding the coffee, a favorite task
he delighted in. Silas had arisen from his chair,
and was wandering about the cozy room looking
at the pictures on the walls, some of them family
portraits.</p>

<p>“Well, I haven’t had much time to say how-d’ye-do,
Leslie,” remarked Dick, as he dropped down
beside the other. “You see with this queer thing
happening it’s excited us a heap. Did you run over
to tell me anything special?”</p>

<p>“Oh!” explained the other, “I was just passing
and thought I’d ask you for that list of books you
promised to give me, some that you won in that
puzzle contest a year ago. I’m getting things
together, you know, so Mr. Holwell can start looking
the books over, and deciding which ones he
thinks suitable for our new library.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad you came when you did,” chuckled
Dick; “because it was just in time to see the reunion.
I guess this is about the queerest thing that
ever happened to us.”</p>

<p>“How did you happen to meet—er, your Uncle
Silas?” queried Leslie.</p>

<p>“Oh! he was sitting by the side of the road resting
when I came by,” the other went on to say.
“My shabby old wheel had broken down, and I
was trundling it along. Only for that I might have
whirled past and never noticed him.”</p>

<p>“Did he stop you and ask who you were?” pursued<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
Leslie, curiously, for the newcomer was just
then at the other side of the room talking with
little Susie.</p>

<p>“Well, we somehow seemed to be attracted
toward each other,” explained Dick. “I felt sorry
for a man who looked so poor and needy, and
when we got to talking he did ask me my name I
believe.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” grunted Leslie, “chances are you invited
him to walk along with you and get something
to eat at your folks’ house. I say that because
it’d be just like you. The poorer the Horners
are the more they want to do things for those
they think worse off than themselves.”</p>

<p>Dick did not take any offense at what his chum
said. Indeed, he even laughed a little as though
he believed it to be a compliment.</p>

<p>“It must be in the blood then,” he told Leslie,
“because none of us can help it. My mother is always
hoping that some day she may fall into a sum
of money, because then she could help so many
other poor people. What, not going already, Leslie?”</p>

<p>“I must,” replied the other who had arisen.
“Give me the list of books you have, Dick. You
might step outside with me,” he added in a whisper,
“because I’d like to say a few words in your
ear that I don’t dare get off here.”</p>

<p>Dick knew his chum so well that he thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
nothing of this rather strange request. He went
into his own small den and quickly came back bearing
a slip of paper.</p>

<p>“There you are,” he told the other, “and I
don’t believe Mr. Holwell can put a black cross
against any one on the list, because they’re all
splendid, thrilling, uplifting stories, and bound to
do any fellow heaps of good reading them.”</p>

<p>He led the way to the outer air. The night was
coming on though it was not fully dark. There
was a suspicion of colder weather in the air, although
as yet no one could call it chilly.</p>

<p>“Now what do you want to say to me that you
didn’t care to tell indoors, Leslie?”</p>

<p>“Only this, Dick,” replied the other; “don’t believe
<i>all</i> that old chap says. He may be what he
claims, but I’ve got my doubts about it.”</p>

<p>“Then you must have a good reason for thinking
that way?” urged Dick, hardly pleased at hearing
his chum speak in this strain.</p>

<p>“I’m going on general principles to begin with,”
continued Leslie, unabashed, “for while I’m not
from Missouri I have to be shown before I believe.
Besides, according to my humble opinion,
the story he tells is decidedly fishy.”</p>

<p>“Oh! do you think so?” asked Dick, chuckling,
for it usually amused him to find his friend acting
in this way. In times past he had even dubbed
Leslie the Great Objector. “All of us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
seem to believe what he says, and mother surely
ought to recognize her own long-lost brother.”</p>

<p>“It would seem so,” admitted Leslie, slowly.
“But to tell you the truth, I don’t altogether like
his ways. He strikes me as a chap who is playing
some sort of clever game.”</p>

<p>“That’s a pretty serious accusation to make, old
fellow,” argued Dick. “Now, if the Horners were
well-to-do, there might be some reason for a scamp
to scheme to hoodwink us. But great governor!
what could any one expect to get here?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” admitted Leslie, who, however,
was very tenacious in his ways, and could not be
easily induced to desert his guns. “But something
tells me he is up to some dark scheme.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” laughed Dick, “perhaps now he’s learned
in a mysterious way that the Horners have fallen
heir to some great big fortune, though they don’t
know it yet themselves. And as you say, he may
be intending to hang around so as to steal valuable
papers that will enable him to claim the
same. That must be what you’ve got in mind,
Leslie—a regular movies stunt.”</p>

<p>“Now you’re making fun of me, Dick,” complained
the other. “But I sat there and pretended
to play with Susie, while I kept one eye on your
so-called Uncle Silas. And Dick, I could see him
chuckling to himself every little while as if something
tickled him immensely.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>“Well, what of that?” urged Dick, stoutly.
“He’s had hard luck all his life, and I can understand
how pleased he must be to come on folks
who belong to him. A rover they say, when he
gets real old and sickly, always thinks of the past.
Now, for my part, I seem to take to Uncle Silas
quite well. We may find a way to keep him with
us right along.”</p>

<p>“Listen,” said Leslie, as he was about to hurry
off, “I saw him take up one of the tea spoons and
look at it. Then he nodded his head as if he had
found it real silver you know, one of those few
heirlooms your poor mother thinks so much of.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Dick, humorously, “if anybody
ever ran across anything worth taking in the Horner
home, I’d make him divide with me. So-long,
Leslie, and thank you for the warning. But we
Horners are always willing to take a chance, you
know.”</p>

<small>COUNTER CURRENTS IN THE “GYM”</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">How</span> are you coming on with your farce,
Dick?” asked Mr. Holwell, the next evening, as
he stepped in at the Y. M. C. A. building to see
how the boys were coming on, and also to fulfill
several errands.</p>

<p>“Oh! I seem to be forging right ahead, sir,”
laughed Dick, “though I find it a pretty hard proposition
to get up the songs and choruses. I don’t
believe I could have tackled the job only for your
permission to get such assistance in the song part
that we could from any of our young companions.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you told me before that one of the girls
had been helping you there,” remarked the minister,
who was showing a very deep interest in all
of the boys belonging to the new department of
the association. “I have given the same permission
to all who intend to compete. But it is expressly
understood that the words of the songs
and choruses, as well as everything save the musical
score, must be entirely original with the ones<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
who submit their farces to the committee, or else
they will be thrown out.”</p>

<p>“Sometimes I am almost tempted to tear mine
up,” admitted Dick, frankly; “because it reads silly
to me; but my folks at home seem to like it, and
my chum Leslie says it is fine. But then, I guess
he only tells me that because he is my chum.”</p>

<p>“Don’t think of tearing it up, my boy,” urged
the minister, earnestly. “Many a famous man has
had his hours of doubt, and come near abandoning
the career he had marked out for himself. You
are no judge of your own productions. Older
heads must decide on the merits of the compositions.
Promise me that no matter what you think
you will finish the farce and hand it in.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I can promise you that, sir,” replied Dick,
flushing with pleasure, since he felt that Mr. Holwell
had a certain amount of confidence in him.</p>

<p>Shortly afterward the minister left the building,
having accomplished what errands he had in view
when entering. It was the one evening in the week
when the juniors were allowed the freedom of the
gymnasium, and a dozen fellows had already donned
their “gym” garments, so that they could have
perfect freedom of movement when exercising in
their favorite ways.</p>

<p>Nat and Dit were on hand, for they never
missed an opportunity to be present on “gym”
night. Indeed, Dick strongly suspected it was this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
very thing that had tempted Nat and his cronies to
swallow their pride, and send that apology to Mr.
Holwell.</p>

<p>Being quite an athlete, Nat always took a leading
part in the varied exercises of the gymnasium.
He could do many feats that caused some of the
other less muscular and agile boys to envy him
very much.</p>

<p>Mr. Holwell, who read boys so well, understood
that it was only a slender hold the association had
on such a wild fellow as Nat. He hoped, however,
that by degrees the influences of the new life
might serve to tone the other down, and cause
him to change his ways.</p>

<p>After some of the boys had tired themselves out
in their exercises with the parallel bars, the swinging
hoops, the lifting weights, and many other devices
calculated to make them stronger in every
way, they clustered around Nat, who was holding
forth on the subject of his farce.</p>

<p>“Wait till you hear it,” he was telling them in
his exultant and superior way. “Chances are you’ll
double up like a hinge with every page that’s read.
Am I right, Dit?” and as he said this last he turned
on his “shadow,” Dit Hennesy, who, as always,
was hovering close by Nat.</p>

<p>“Say, it’s sure a screamer,” asserted the other,
vigorously. “Talk to me about funny business,
Nat’s got every minstrel show beat to a frazzle.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
He read some of the stuff to me last night, and I’m
giving you the straight thing when I tell you my
mother says she heard me laughing in my sleep
ever so many times.”</p>

<p>Nat grinned happily as he looked around. Then
his eye fell on Dick, who he very well knew was
also writing a farce so as to enter the competition
for the golden prize.</p>

<p>“I reckon that makes you feel some sore, eh,
Dick?” he sneered, as though delighted at the opportunity
to pay back some of the long score he
thought he owed the other. “Course you’re doing
your level best; but shucks! you’re only wasting
your time let me tell you. There never was, and
there never will be as funny a farce as I’m goin’ to
spring on the committee. Huh! even makes me
laugh myself when I get off a rattlin’ good joke,
and hurry to write it down before I forget it.”</p>

<p>To tell the truth, Dick did feel as though he
hardly had the ghost of a chance in the competition,
after hearing all this boasting. Not for
worlds, however, would he let that fellow see him
look downcast. So he laughed good-naturedly as
he went on to say in reply:</p>

<p>“Oh! well, I’m doing my level best, and that’s
all any fellow can do. If the committee turns
down my effort, all right. I’ll take my medicine
without whimpering. I believe the best original
farce ought to win, and that’s all there is to it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>Nat looked keenly at him as though he wondered
whether Dick could have any hidden meaning
back of his words.</p>

<p>“Well, you see,” he continued, “I’m one of the
kind of fellows always on the lookout for a chance
to get off a crackin’ good joke on people. That
helps me a heap in doin’ my writin’. Right now
I’ve been thinking up a little scheme to give old
Limpy Peters, the shoemaker, the scare of his
life.”</p>

<p>“How’s that, Nat?” asked Dit Hennesy, as he
invariably did when the other showed signs of
having conjured up some scheme that promised
to give them the selfish enjoyment felt by the boy
who was stoning the frogs.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you,” chuckled Nat, who seemed to be
feeling particularly jolly on this occasion. “You
know Limpy Peters lost his wife some years ago.
He always goes to the graveyard on nights when
there’s a full moon, and sits there a long time like
a silly old fool. Well, I’m thinking what fun it’d
be to hide near that place and start to groaning
when he comes. Say, just try to picture that cripple
makin’ tracks for the gate, will you? It’d be
enough to make a mummy grin to see him tumblin’
all over himself.”</p>

<p>Dit, of course, laughed as though he thought it
a good idea. Several other boys being thoughtless,
also chuckled, as they mentally pictured the poor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
cobbler stumbling and falling in his fright and
mad desire to escape.</p>

<p>Others, however, frowned on the foolish
scheme, and could be heard muttering the word
“shame.” Nat stiffened up, and his cheeks flamed
with anger. He looked at Dick, as though believing
that he had been loudest in his condemnation.</p>

<p>“Seems you don’t like my little joke any too
well, hey, Dick Horner?” he demanded, with a
scowl. “Well, mebbe you can originate a better
one yourself.”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand what it’s got to do with
getting up a farce, and I’d like you to explain that
part to me,” Dick told him, calmly.</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed the other, with a scornful
laugh, “that shows that you don’t appreciate the
glorious possibilities a situation like that offers a
real author of farces. I’m deep in it right now,
and the conversation that is carried on between
the poor scared chap in the graveyard and the supposed
ghost would make you split your sides laughing,
just to hear it.”</p>

<p>“Why,” spoke up the dutiful Dit, “I wanted him
to read it to me, but he just wouldn’t. He said it’d
make me so weak with laughin’ I never could walk
home. Say, if it’s any better than what I did hear
it sure must be a corker.”</p>

<p>“But why frighten poor Limpy Peters when
you’re getting on so well as it is?” demanded Dick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>“Huh! shows your ignorance when you say
that,” snorted Nat. “When a dramatist gets up
a show he always wants to try it on the dog first,
before it’s played in a big city. So I want to get
what they call <i>inspiration</i> by seeing just how scared
Limpy Peters will be when I groan, and carry
on.”</p>

<p>“Shame on you, Nat!” said Leslie Capes, indignantly.</p>

<p>“Yes, and a whole lot of us echo that sentiment,”
Dick went on to say. “Poor old Limpy
Peters has suffered terribly in his life. Nearly
every boy in Cliffwood thinks a heap of the old
man, and for one I won’t stand by and hear of his
being pestered, as you say, just to give you ‘inspiration.’”</p>

<p>“Huh! you talk pretty big, Dick Horner,”
snapped Nat, with one of his lofty looks. “What’d
you do about it if I said I’d carry on as I pleased?”</p>

<p>Dick faced him with flashing eyes. Somehow
he was fully aroused by now, and meant to give
the other a piece of his mind.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what I’ll do for one thing!” he exclaimed,
“and unless I miss my guess, there are a
lot of other fellows here who feel the same way.
I’ll tell Mr. Holwell about your scheme, and he’ll
see to it that old Peters is warned. Then if you
try what you threaten you may get in a peck of
trouble.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>“That’s my way of thinking, too!” asserted Leslie,
instantly ranging alongside of his chum. “We
listened to you on Hallowe’en, and came near getting
arrested for entering Mr. Nocker’s house to
give him a scare.”</p>

<p>“Better forget about this idea, Nat,” warned
Peg Fosdick. “For one I’d never stand to hear
of poor old Peters being scared half to death. I
know what it is to limp myself, and can feel for
the lame cobbler.”</p>

<p>“Count me in as being opposed to that sort of
cruel joke!” declared Andy Hale.</p>

<p>“Ditto here!” sang out Clint Babbett. “Time’s
gone by when I could get any real fun out of giving
pain to other people.”</p>

<p>“Plenty of other ways to find amusement, so
far as I’m concerned, and so put me down as being
with you, Dick, if you feel that you’ve got to give
Nat away to Mr. Holwell,” observed Elmer
Jones, positively.</p>

<p>Nat glared around him. To tell the truth every
one seemed against him save his crony Dit Hennesy.</p>

<p>“Oh! well,” he laughed harshly; “seein’ that
you’re so timid a bunch, I’ll call the joke off.
Reckon I can finish my little imaginary conversation
between the ghost and the cobbler without
tryin’ it on the dog. And you needn’t say a word
to Mr. Holwell about it, Dick; unless you’re itchin’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
to get me put out of the game so you could have
a walk-over.”</p>

<p>Dick felt the sneer, and turned red, but held his
ground.</p>

<p>“I’ll promise not to say a word to Mr. Holwell,”
he told Nat. “But I mean to let Limpy
know some boys are thinking of playing a practical
joke on him one of these nights, so he can carry
a pistol along with him when he goes to sit by the
grave of his wife. That’s all I’ve got to say about
it.”</p>

<p>“Oh! forget it,” sneered Nat. “I don’t take
any chances with a shooting-iron. Limpy needn’t
bother, for I won’t molest him.”</p>

<p>The look he gave Dick as he turned away was
an ugly one.</p>

<p>“Better watch out more than ever for Nat,
Dick,” cautioned Leslie, as the two of them walked
home together that evening. “He’s got it in for
you as sure as anything.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I’m not bothering my head about his ever
laying a hand on me,” declared the other boy, indifferently.
“I only wish I could be as sure that his
farce wouldn’t make my effort look silly. From
what they say, Nat must be a rattling good hand at
writing that sort of thing. Of course, I’ll keep
on trying my best, but I’m afraid there isn’t much
chance of my winning those twenty-five gold dollars.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br>

<small>THE NIGHT ALARM</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a hard thing for Leslie to keep away
from the Horner home these days. He had much
in common with Dick to talk over, what with the
progress of the black-face farce; the wonderful
scheme Dick was carrying out looking to the bringing
together of old Deacon Nocker and his son’s
little family; and now, last of all, the mystery
hanging over the returned Silas Langhorne.</p>

<p>Leslie was particularly interested in the weary
wanderer who had spent the better part of his life
in the endeavor to coax fortune to pour her favors
into his lap, only to meet with final defeat.</p>

<p>“Even if he is Dick’s real uncle, which I doubt
a whole lot,” he often told himself, “think of the
nerve of him coming here to hang on to those poor
people like a barnacle does to a ship’s keel. Why,
with another mouth to feed, they’ll go hungry
more’n a few times, if the winter’s as hard as they
say it’s going to be. I tell you it doesn’t look right
to me; and I’ve just <i>got</i> to expose that old fraud.”</p>

<p>So Leslie, in pursuance of his determination, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
over with Dick on the night that followed the encounter
at the gymnasium.</p>

<p>Dick was induced to read a little more of his
farce while the two of them sat in his den, and Leslie
again laughed heartily over the humorous way
the writer expressed himself, as well as at the jokes
he worked in between the jolly songs and choruses.</p>

<p>“Don’t you dare get cold feet about this thing,
Dick,” he told his chum sternly, when the other
absolutely refused to read any more that night, as
supper was nearly ready, and Leslie had agreed
to eat with them. “I tell you it’s a peach, and Nat,
for all his boasting, isn’t going to have a show-in.”</p>

<p>Of course, Dick liked to hear that sort of thing,
for he really needed all sorts of encouragement to
bolster up his drooping spirits. That golden prize
hung temptingly before his eyes, but he feared he
was doomed never to clutch it; although already he
had figured out how many things besides a suit of
new clothes it would afford him that winter.</p>

<p>The boys went in to supper when the summons
came. Silas was still in evidence. He looked considerably
better, now that he had washed up, and
brushed the dust from his shabby clothes, which
were pretty nearly all his possessions, for he had
only been carrying a little bundle done up in a gunny-sack
when Dick first met him.</p>

<p>“I ought to be goin’ on my way by this time,”
Silas was remarking, as they sat at the table and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
partook of the humble fare, which, however, was
plentiful enough for that occasion; “though I must
say I’m terribly disappointed at not hearin’ from
my old side partner, Joe Shepard, down in New
York City, in answer to the letter I sent him.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Horner shook her head at hearing that.</p>

<p>“Stay a little longer with us, Silas,” she urged;
“until you are stronger at any rate. You don’t
eat much, and I’m sure, as my only brother, you
are welcome to share in what we have. We put
our trust in Providence, and so far we have never
been forgotten. Something will turn up to help
us, sooner or later.”</p>

<p>This showed Leslie Capes what a splendid little
woman Dick’s mother was, and deep down in
his heart he knew she was right; but all the same
he could not get over his firm distrust of the wanderer.</p>

<p>“As sure as anything,” he told himself as he
continued to eat, “that was something mighty like
a grin I saw workin’ on the old fraud’s face when
she said that. It’s a shame, that’s what it is, the
way he’s imposing on Dick’s folks. I’m just bound
to find him out, so as to expose him for the impostor
he is.”</p>

<p>He meant to warn his chum again, though he
felt pretty confident the other would only laugh at
him, Dick was so frank and unsuspicious himself
by nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>“If I should happen to get real sick, Polly,” he
heard the wanderer saying, “I want you to open
my bundle, and you’ll find just a little mite of
money I’ve hung on to, enough I hope to put me
under the ground decently. I’d feel pretty badly
if I thought I’d come all the way from Alaska just
to make you additional expense in burying me.”</p>

<p>“Don’t speak of it, Silas,” said Mrs. Horner,
shaking her head. “You’re going to rest a bit
now, and perhaps when you get stronger, there
may open up some way for you to earn a little
money. We haven’t reached the end of our scanty
resources yet, I hope.”</p>

<p>“And my quarterly pension money will be coming
along about the first of the year, when we can
pay all we owe, and have a bit left over,” said
Grandpop Horner, proudly. “Ah! I reckon I
earned all Uncle Sam pays me now in my old age,
when you remember the terrible sufferings we endured.
Many a time I lay on the cold ground in
a storm so that my hair was frozen to the soil, and
a comrade had to actually chop me loose with a
hatchet in the morning.”</p>

<p>The garrulous old veteran was so full of reminiscences,
and could be started off so easily, that
Dick and his mother always had to be ready to turn
the conversation into another channel, once he began
to “remember.”</p>

<p>No doubt grandpop found an attentive listener<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
in the returned wanderer, for they had spent many
hours smoking together while the housewife carried
on her numerous duties.</p>

<p>Leslie had really come over on this occasion to
find out when Dick considered the time ripe for
springing the great surprise on Deacon Nocker.
He was beginning to feel impatient about it, and
told Dick as much later on that evening as they
sat in the latter’s little room.</p>

<p>“Never fear,” Dick assured him, “but what it’s
going to be brought to a climax soon now. I think
we’ve got the old gentleman so wrapped up in little
Billy that he would accept a dozen relatives
rather than have the youngster pass out of his life
forever. The deacon is a changed man these days,
lots of people have said; and we know what the
reason for it is.”</p>

<p>“Are you meaning to let him meet his daughter-in-law
as Mrs. Smith,” continued Leslie, “and get
interested in her too, before he learns the staggering
truth that Billy really belongs to him?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Holwell thinks that would be the best
plan,” replied Dick. “He says if the deacon tries
to meet the child’s mother soon, not to interfere.”</p>

<p>“Huh! the easiest way to bring that about,”
said Leslie, eagerly, “would be just to have Billy
stay at home a couple of days. Then you bet Mr.
Nocker’ll hurry over and ask to see the child’s
mother, so as to inquire about Billy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>“Just what Mr. Holwell suggested,” remarked
Dick. “I’ll speak to her about it tomorrow. We
can fix it so when the surprise is sprung perhaps a
few of us who are most interested may be on hand
to see how the old man acts when he learns the
truth.”</p>

<p>“Good for you, Dick!” cried Leslie. “I’d give
a heap to be there when he hears that Billy is his
sure-enough grandson. And I give you my word
he’ll never dream of doing anything but taking
Tilly, his boy Amos’ widow, to his heart to keep
forever. Whee! but this is a glorious scheme
you’ve been playing, a thousand times better all
around than any one of Nat’s grand games, that
are always cruel.”</p>

<p>“I’ve certainly had more real enjoyment out of
it so far than Nat could have found in all his
pranks bunched together,” asserted Dick. “Besides,
it’s going to do several people good; and my
mother has backed me up in it, which pleases me
a whole lot in the bargain.”</p>

<p>“Listen! that’s the wind commencing to blow,
and from the north, too, Dick. I had a hunch it’d
come up strong about ten tonight, and give us some
real winter weather again. How it moans around
the corner of the house. They say that’s always a
sure sign of cold weather.”</p>

<p>“Let it blow,” laughed Dick, “so far as I’m
concerned. We’ve got a tight roof overhead, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
plenty of coal in the cellar, for a time at least. If
the cold gives us a thick coat of ice on the pond for
skating, so much the better. But as you say it does
begin to howl like sixty around that north end of
the house.”</p>

<p>“Whee! I should think your Uncle Silas”—how
Leslie did enjoy putting emphasis on that
word “Uncle” whenever he spoke it—“would
shake hands with himself over the change in his
fortunes since he struck the Horner cottage. If
he had to camp out on a night like this he’d shake
half to pieces.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I’m glad he doesn’t have to,” remarked
Dick, firmly. “He’s told us a good many thrilling
things that have happened to him in all these years
of his wanderings; and I guess the poor old chap
feels like a ship that’s reached the end of its last
voyage.”</p>

<p>Leslie laughed softly at hearing Dick say this.</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that, Dick,” he ventured
to remark. “According to my notion, he’s got considerable
of a hold on life yet. Mebbe now that
things have turned so pleasant for him he may linger
a long time. They nearly always do, my father
says, with no worries on their minds.”</p>

<p>“Hark! wasn’t that the fire bell?” suddenly demanded
Dick, jumping up.</p>

<p>“It sure enough is!” echoed the other boy, as
the clanging sounds came more plainly than before;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
“and what a terribly hard night for a blaze,
too. Where’s my hat and coat, Dick? I never
could keep from running to a fire.”</p>

<p>“I’m with you there, old fellow!” said Dick,
as he hastily donned his outer garment, after which
both lads hastened from the house.</p>

<p>“Look there!” exclaimed Leslie, almost immediately.
“A bright light is leaping up; and Dick,
honest to goodness it’s coming from that direction
too. I’m afraid it must be either Deacon Nocker’s
house, or the Brandon place next door!”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br>

<small>AT THE FIRE</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">The</span> Brandon place!” echoed Dick, catching
his breath as a sudden chill passed over him.
“What if it should be, and little Billy there!”</p>

<p>Somehow neither of them seemed to give one
thought to the old deacon. Indeed, possibly in all
Cliffwood there could hardly have been found a
single boy who would have cared a snap of his
finger if Jed Nocker’s fine house went up in flame
and smoke.</p>

<p>“Let’s get away!” suggested Leslie, hastily.</p>

<p>“I’m with you!” Dick snapped out, and with
that both started at headlong speed, making in the
direction of that bright and ever increasing light.</p>

<p>One good thing was that they would not have
very far to run, for the Brandon place, as well as
that of the deacon adjoining, was only a short distance
from the modest home of the Horners.</p>

<p>Hardly had they started when they became
aware of the fact that others besides themselves
were heading toward the scene of the conflagration.
Swiftly moving figures could be discovered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
in the half darkness, and all converging toward
the same spot.</p>

<p>Sounds, too, began to be heard. Whenever that
metallic clang started in Cliffwood, as the hammer
was beaten on the suspended steel rim of a
railway locomotive driving wheel, it aroused the
most intense excitement.</p>

<p>People could be heard shouting across back
fences, asking one another where the fire could be.
Doubtless, the one thought in the minds of all
was that with that rising north wind it would prove
to be a bad night for a conflagration.</p>

<p>The alarm still continued to sound. Men came
dashing out of houses wearing their enameled fire
hats, and perhaps hastily drawing on their leather
coats. The fire-fighting department of Cliffwood,
like most towns of its size, was a volunteer one,
the members serving as a duty they owed to the
community.</p>

<p>“Faster, Dick!” gasped Leslie, as the two boys
hastened along. “She’s bulging up like everything,
don’t you see? And it’s sure enough that
place!”</p>

<p>Dick knew that already, for he had the lay of
the land well fixed in his mind. It meant that
Billy, yes, and Billy’s little mother as well, might
be in dire danger, for the cruel flames would be no
respecter of persons.</p>

<p>So the boys ran at even a faster gait than before,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
if such a thing were possible. When, presently,
they arrived at the gate of the Brandon place, it
was to find that others were ahead of them. Quite
a group of people could be seen in the grounds,
staring at the spectacle presented by the burning
house, exchanging all manner of comments, but
really doing nothing to save life or property, from
lack of a leader.</p>

<p>The first thing Dick did was to cast his eyes
hastily around. He was, of course, looking for
some sign of the handsome little chap and his
mother, Tilly. When that sweeping look failed to
find either of those in whose welfare he was so
deeply interested, Dick again felt a coldness in the
region of his heart.</p>

<p>A great shouting down the road announced that
the fire laddies were coming on the run with the
machine. They would be on hand in a few minutes,
Dick realized, but at the same time it was
evident that even seconds were precious, and might
cost those in peril their lives.</p>

<p>Leslie gripped his arm just then.</p>

<p>“See there, isn’t that she, Dick?” he cried, huskily,
for he was laboring under great excitement,
and it was really a wonder he could speak at all.</p>

<p>“I don’t see her,” Dick replied, anxiously, as he
scrutinized the little group at which his chum was
pointing his finger.</p>

<p>“Oh! I didn’t mean Billy’s mother,” Leslie hastened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
to explain. “I meant the woman she has
stopping with her to help with the work.”</p>

<p>Dick saw now, and was off like a flash, leaving
his chum to follow at his heels. If any one would
know about Billy and his mother, surely Mrs.
Kelly should. She was trying to answer the numerous
questions being showered upon her by those
around; but since virtually no one knew that there
had been a tenant in the Brandon house they could
not realize the extreme gravity of the situation.</p>

<p>Dick pushed his way into the group. He seized
hold of the excited woman’s arm, and there was
something so like authority in the boy’s action that
Mrs. Kelly stopped crying and turned toward him.</p>

<p>“Where are Billy and his mother?” demanded
the boy.</p>

<p>The woman turned and pointed at the burning
house, one end of which was by this time a mass
of flames.</p>

<p>“In there, I’m half afraid,” she half screamed.
“Oh! the pore little chappie and his swate mother
will be kilt entirely I do be afraid!”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” demanded a hoarse voice just
then, and half turning his head, Leslie saw the deacon
standing there, his face white, and drawn as
with a spasm of pain.</p>

<p>Possibly Dick knew the old man was at his elbow
but he had no time just then to bother with him.
With little Billy in deadly peril, the affairs of Deacon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
Nocker played a very small part in the boy’s
mind.</p>

<p>Something must be done, and that without loss
of time. Undoubtedly, the widow must be asleep
in the burning mansion, quite unaware of the danger
surrounding her; and of course Billy shared
her peril.</p>

<p>Dick whirled on his chum. Well did he know
that Leslie would stand back of him in the rash
undertaking that he was now bent on accepting;
for he had seen this comrade tested on many a previous
occasion, and in every instance Leslie had
proven as true as steel.</p>

<p>“We must make the try, if you’re ready to go
in with me!” he cried, pointing to where the front
door of the building stood invitingly open, the
work-woman having evidently escaped by that
means when she found the house afire.</p>

<p>“You bet I’m going to make the try!” Leslie
assured him.</p>

<p>“Wait till the firemen get here, boys!” urged
one woman, who possibly had boys of her own at
home, and shuddered at the thought of their dashing
into the doomed house, even though it were to
save human life.</p>

<p>“It might be too late then,” snapped Dick.
“Come on, Leslie. Wet your handkerchief in this
bucket, and cover your nose with it as much as you
can, for the smoke will be something terrible.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>That was a most sensible suggestion which Dick
made. Even if they did not come into contact
with the leaping flames, the smoke was thick
enough to smother them.</p>

<p>Several of the men who had stood around doing
nothing, upon seeing what the two daring boys
meant to attempt, called out to them. Some applauded
their schemes, while others told them they
were foolish, because the chances were they would
not only fail to accomplish anything but lose their
own lives in the bargain.</p>

<p>“Let them alone, can’t you?” shouted the shrill
voice of Deacon Nocker. “They are ten times
braver than any one of you cowards; and they will
save Billy yet, I know they will—they <i>must</i>, I tell
you! Go on, boys, and God bless you!”</p>

<p>Neither Dick nor Leslie would soon forget that
moment while they dabbled their handkerchiefs in
the cold water contained in the pail, and then
dashed headlong through the open door of the old
Brandon house.</p>

<p>“Keep in touch with me!” Dick had called out
over his shoulder; for the flames and the shouting
people made such a racket by this time that one
had to raise his voice in order to be heard.</p>

<p>Then they vanished from the gaze of the horrified
group; and doubtless many of the onlookers
firmly believed they would never again set eyes on
the venturesome lads.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>It was fortunate that Dick knew all about the
interior of that house, thanks to his frequent visits.
Had it been otherwise, he might have floundered
around, and led his chum into a trap from
which escape would have been difficult, if not impossible.</p>

<p>The smoke was very dense, so that seeing was
a hard task. Through the billows of black vapor
they could, however, catch glimpses of the darting
flames that looked like red tongues licking up the
woodwork of the doomed building.</p>

<p>Dick had no particular plan arranged, for the
whole thing had come upon them so suddenly that
there had been little time to do any thinking. He
meant to get to where he expected to find the
widow and her boy, perhaps unconscious in the
smoke; and then rescue them in some manner, it
might be by means of the windows.</p>

<p>Groping his way along the hall, Dick found himself
at the foot of the stairs up which he and his
companion must make their way, for the sleeping
rooms were all on the second story.</p>

<p>The fire was dreadfully close. They could feel
its burning heat upon their faces, and despite the
ready handkerchiefs, the pungent smoke almost
choked them. Nevertheless, Dick did not hesitate
for even a fraction of a minute. Up those
stairs they must rush, no matter if the fire had already
seized upon the railing in places.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br>

<small>THE DARING RESCUE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Just</span> how they made their way up those stairs
Leslie never could tell. The first thing he knew
he found himself on the upper landing, and facing
a sheet of flames that made the whirling smoke
wreaths look strangely like some kind of demon
stretching out a myriad hands toward him.</p>

<p>Dick was for pushing on, even though to do so
he had to advance in the direction where the
fire was most furious. He kept fingering the wall
as he went, because with one hand holding the tied
handkerchief partly over his eyes he could not depend
on his sight to tell him when he reached the
door of the room in which he knew the widow had
taken up her quarters with her little son.</p>

<p>Fortunately, it was not at the extreme rear of
the house, where the fire seemed to be in absolute
control. Dick remembered feeling very thankful
on this account as he continued to grope his way
along.</p>

<p>Whenever the flames died down for a second
or two, the utmost darkness reigned in that upper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
hall. Then, suddenly, there would come another
flash of brilliant illumination, accompanied by a
dull roar.</p>

<p>Now they had reached the door he sought. To
the horror of the boy when he turned the knob, it
refused to give way. Evidently, when Mrs.
Nocker went to her room earlier in the evening,
she had locked the door, being more or less timid
about sleeping in the big house, with only Mrs.
Kelly for company, and she in a distant part of the
building.</p>

<p>Dick commenced to pound on the door with his
clenched fist. Leslie added to the din by kicking
furiously at the panels.</p>

<p>“Tilly! wake up! wake up!” shouted Dick, using
the name he had heard his mother speak so
often; for this young widow of Amos Nocker had
seemed almost like her own daughter to kind-hearted
Mrs. Horner. “Mrs. Nocker, wake up!”</p>

<p>There was no reply to all this racket. Apparently,
the smoke had reduced the inmate of the
room to a condition where she knew next to nothing
of what was going on around her.</p>

<p>Some boys would have been tempted to give up
in despair when meeting with such apparently insurmountable
difficulties. Dick was not built along
that order. He no longer used his fists to pound
on the door, but started to hurl himself against the
panels as furiously as possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>Again and again did he cast his whole weight
forward, regardless of the shock he sustained
through the impact. He could feel that with each
successive smash the fastenings of the door seemed
to weaken. This encouraged the boy to even
greater exertions, and there was Leslie, too, adding
his weight to the assault.</p>

<p>After half a dozen blows of this character, the
door could hold out no longer, and Dick found
himself staggering into the room. It was filled
with smoke, though as yet the flames had not intruded.</p>

<p>Dick started to grope his way over to the nearest
window, which, upon reaching, he threw wide
open. This created a draught of air, and started
the stagnant smoke to moving outwardly.</p>

<p>“Here they are, Dick!” he heard Leslie shouting,
and it gave him a thrill just to know that he
had at least made no mistake in the apartment.</p>

<p>The widow must have fallen asleep in her chair,
for she was fully clothed, and had undoubtedly
been unconsciously inhaling the suffocating smoke
as she slept. Billy was in his little bed close by,
his curly head almost covered by the spread, which
fact Dick believed had been the main cause for
his not succumbing before now.</p>

<p>When Dick shook him the boy aroused himself.
He was drowsy, and hardly seemed to know where
he was, or who had awakened him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>Dick snatched the child up in his arms, wrapping
a blanket around him. Leslie, in the meantime,
was shaking Tilly, with some hope of arousing
her to a sense of her peril, for neither of the
boys could readily carry her from the building.</p>

<p>He was meeting with some measure of success,
too, for already Tilly had moved, and possibly the
shock of finding herself surrounded by smoke
would start her into fresh activity.</p>

<p>“Can you get her on her feet?” shouted Dick in
his chum’s ear.</p>

<p>“I’ll do my best,” replied the other, bravely.</p>

<p>“Wait for me here,” Dick went on to tell him.
“I’ll take a look, and see if we dare risk the stairs
again.”</p>

<p>Dick had not forgotten those creeping flames
that were already attacking the banisters when they
ascended. He had a fear that even in so short a
time they might have attained such headway as to
make a further use of the stairs impossible.</p>

<p>No sooner had he pushed out into the upper
hall than he discovered that his worst fears were
realized, for the fire had made such headway that
the stairs seemed to be a mass of flames, through
which any descent might be reckoned impossible.</p>

<p>Back into the room Dick hurried. The little fellow
whom he had swathed in the blanket, moved
uneasily in his arms, but seemed fairly content to
allow himself to be taken care of. Perhaps he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
had recognized Dick’s voice when the boy spoke in
his ear, and felt the utmost confidence in his protector.</p>

<p>Once in the room, Dick found to his extreme satisfaction,
that Leslie had succeeded in arousing the
young woman. Tilly was able to walk by now,
though still in a half stupor, and hardly comprehending
what it all meant.</p>

<p>“How about it?” shouted Leslie, as he discovered
the presence of his chum; and it must be confessed
that there was considerable anxiety in
his tone, for the situation looked most desperate.</p>

<p>“No use trying the stairs again,” Dick sent back
at him. “They’re all afire. We must escape
through a window, I reckon!”</p>

<p>This was not the most comforting news Leslie
could have received, for when he had thrust his
head out of the said window it was to see forked
flames shooting from below, and twisting upwards
menacingly.</p>

<p>Dick himself did not like the looks of things it
seemed, for after a hurried examination, he drew
back again.</p>

<p>“Cut off there, it looks like!” he called. “Along
at the other window there’s a better chance. Come
after me, and fetch Mrs. Nocker.”</p>

<p>The other window he kicked out as he reached
it, and the jangling glass must have made a queer
sound as it rattled to the ground below. One look<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
told Dick that so far the fire had not reached this
particular section of the house. The earth lay
about fifteen feet below, and had he only himself
to think about a handy water pipe would have
afforded him a ready means of getting down.</p>

<p>Placing Billy on the floor, Dick darted over to
the bed he had seen in a corner of the room. From
this he snatched all the covers, sheets, blankets
and spread, and was back at the window in a
“jiffy,” as he would himself have said.</p>

<p>Again looking out he saw that there were moving
figures down below. Some of the fire-fighters
had arrived, and were hurrying around the house
to find where they could best attack the flames,
once the water came into the hose they carried.</p>

<p>Dick instantly started to shout at them, and
great was the surprise of the men at discovering a
head in the open window; for like most of Cliffwood’s
citizens, up to then they had firmly believed
the Brandon place untenanted.</p>

<p>“Come below here!” was what Dick called at
the top of his voice. “There is a child up with us,
and a lady too. The stairs are all ablaze, and
we can’t get down that way. You must help us!”</p>

<p>“All right, sonny!” shouted the foreman, whom
Dick recognized as big Hen Hess, the brawny
blacksmith of the town. “We’ll have you out of
that safe and sound, never fear. Don’t jump,
whatever you do!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>With that he sent several of the men hurrying
away. No doubt they were intending to fetch a
ladder; but impatient Dick could not wait for that.
He hurried once more back to the bed, and carried
the mattress with him across the room, thrusting
it through the window, and allowing it to fall
to the ground.</p>

<p>Next, he snatched up a blanket and hurled this
down to the hands uplifted to catch it.</p>

<p>“Hold that out, for I’m going to drop the boy
down!” he shouted between his two hands, held up
in lieu of a speaking trumpet.</p>

<p>The firemen knew their business, and four of
them instantly stretched the stout blanket as wide
as it would go. Then Dick, without the least hesitation,
held little Billy, still swathed in his covering,
through the window, and let him drop.</p>

<p>“Bully! he’s safe, all right!” exclaimed Leslie.</p>

<p>Tilly gave a scream when she saw Dick let
her little darling drop; but on discovering that
the child was safe, had once more shown that she
was fully aroused to the occasion. She assisted
Dick to fasten one end of some knotted sheets
around her body under the arms, and was even in
the act of clambering through the window, meaning
to allow the boys to lower her, when Leslie
gave a whoop.</p>

<p>“There they come with the ladder, Dick! We
go down as easy as falling off a log, after all!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br>

<small>HURRYING MATTERS ALONG</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">It’s</span> coming just in time!” Dick was telling himself,
when he saw what rapid headway the flames
were making around that side of the house.</p>

<p>A delay of five minutes might have imperiled
their chances for escape. And on that account,
Dick was glad to see some of the firemen rushing
a ladder straight toward the window, with a pack
of excited people following at their heels, eager
to observe what was going on.</p>

<p>When the ladder was placed, Dick instantly
clambered out, and upon it. He did not mean that
any of the firemen should have the credit for rescuing
Mrs. Nocker after he and his chum had
gone as far as they had.</p>

<p>“Help her out, Leslie,” he shouted to the other;
“and then you come along too.”</p>

<p>Tilly was still frightened by all these exciting
conditions, but she had seen her darling saved
from the flames, and was ready to do whatever
she was told. So with the help of both the boys,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
she soon had her feet planted on a rung of the
ladder, and had commenced the descent.</p>

<p>Loud shouts of approval arose from the spectators,
who by now had recognized Dick and his
companion.</p>

<p>“It’s the Widow Horner’s boy!” he heard one
woman shrilly call out; and somehow Dick felt a
flush of pride at realizing that on this occasion at
least he need experience no sense of shame at being
placed in the spot-light.</p>

<p>All reached the ground in safety, and were
quickly surrounded by the exultant people. Many
curious glances were cast at Tilly, for it must be
remembered that she was an utter stranger in Cliffwood,
and few had even known that the Brandon
house boasted an occupant.</p>

<p>Naturally, the first thing in Mrs. Nocker’s mind
was her boy. Until she had him again in her arms,
she could not stop to answer any questions, or even
take notice of friendly offers of temporary shelter,
such as kind-hearted people were only too ready
to make.</p>

<p>“Take me to my child!” she kept crying, half
hysterically. “I want my Billy! Oh! I hope he
has not been burned! Didn’t you say he was safe,
Dick, dear Dick? What do we not owe you! But
take me to Billy, please!”</p>

<p>No one could blame the poor little woman for
acting in this nervous fashion, after the exciting experiences<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
through which she had just gone. Least
of all did Dick think of considering her weak. He
was too happy over having succeeded in his task
to think of Tilly in any other way than that she
had shown remarkable bravery for one of her
sex.</p>

<p>“Where is the child?” he asked one of the gaping
bystanders.</p>

<p>“A woman took him in her arms, and carried
him back yonder,” was the reply, when another
man chimed in with his share of information:</p>

<p>“It was Mrs. Pettijohn, the tailor’s wife. She
said she would be only too glad to take the child
over to her house across the way, and give him
and his mother shelter!”</p>

<p>“There she is talking to Jed Nocker!” added
still a third member of the group, pointing as he
spoke.</p>

<p>Nothing could hold Tilly back now, and Dick
did not make any attempt to detain her, although
something seemed to tell him that there was danger
of his well laid plan being brought to a crisis
in an unexpected and altogether hasty manner.</p>

<p>When they reached the spot where Mrs. Pettijohn
stood with Billy, still partly swathed in his
blanket, in her arms, it was to find that Deacon
Nocker was demanding the possession of the little
fellow.</p>

<p>“Give him to me, Mrs. Pettijohn!” he was saying,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
holding out his arms entreatingly. But the
woman shook her head, for she could not see why
she should surrender any child to a man who had
always been known to detest all young people.</p>

<p>“Why should I do that, Mr. Nocker?” she told
him, aggressively. “You know nothing about children,
and I’ve raised seven in my day. Besides,
excuse me for saying it, but you’re really the last
one in all Cliffwood I’d want to hand this little darling
over to just now. He’d break his heart crying
just to look at your face.”</p>

<p>“But you don’t understand, Mrs. Pettijohn,”
urged the excited deacon, still with arms extended;
“Billy and I are already good friends. We have
been together every day for weeks now. He
knows me, and cares a lot for me. My house is
close by, and he can have everything he needs;
yes, and his mother too, if she will accept of my
hospitality. Billy, come to me, my fine boy, won’t
you?”</p>

<p>Billy evidently recognized the old gentleman,
for he did make some sort of half movement in
the arms of the tailor’s wife. Just then Tilly herself
pounced upon them.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pettijohn realized who the little woman
was, and she readily surrendered the child to
her motherly care. Fiercely, Tilly strained him to
her heart, at the same time covering his sweet face
with burning kisses! Then she would hold him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
off to gaze anxiously as though still half filled
with dread lest she discover some hideous mark
where the cruel tongues of fire had licked his tender
skin.</p>

<p>Billy put his arms about her neck again and
again. Of course, he was too young to know what
all this fuss was about, but the smoke smarted his
eyes so that the tears had been running down his
cheeks, and he was looking unusually charming in
the eyes of the eager deacon.</p>

<p>Dick laid a hand on the arm of his chum. For
the time being both of them apparently forgot all
about the burning house, and the hustling firemen
who had finally succeeded in getting a line of hose
to work. Both lads were intensely interested in
the little drama that was being played before their
eyes, and with which they had had so much to
do.</p>

<p>The deacon hovered close by. Evidently, he
was only waiting to repeat that generous offer of
his as to a harbor for the two who were without
a roof to cover them. Dick wondered what Mrs.
Nocker would say, now that she found herself face
to face with the hard-hearted old man who had
written her that cruel letter.</p>

<p>One of the women had been thoughtful enough
to fetch the blanket along which Dick threw from
the window before allowing little Billy to drop.
This she wrapped the best she could about Tilly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
now shivering with the chill air; so that as she
stood there she looked not unlike some Indian
squaw carrying her papoose in her arms.</p>

<p>“Watch, Dick, for it’s coming now!” said Leslie,
in his chum’s ear, as he saw old Mr. Nocker
pushing forward, as though determined to assert
his rights as the nearest neighbor.</p>

<p>“Pardon me, madam,” they heard the deacon
say, as softly as he could tone down his usually
harsh voice. “Are you Billy’s mother?”</p>

<p>Tilly did not need to be told who the old man
with the stern face was. Doubtless she had
watched him in secret many times when he was sitting
there on that bench chatting with her child,
and perhaps felt her heart fail her as she contemplated
the severe expression on his countenance.</p>

<p>Still, Dick noticed with secret admiration that
she did not quail when the supreme test came, but
stood her ground bravely. It might be that Tilly
felt she was doubly armed now, knowing what a
firm hold Billy had taken on the affections of his
grandfather.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I am Billy’s mother,” she said, simply.</p>

<p>“And I am your next door neighbor, Deacon
Nocker,” the old man went on to say, eagerly.
“You must know that your dear little boy and I
have become great chums of late. I love him with
all my heart, madam, I assure you; and it was my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
intention to call upon his mother very shortly. See,
he recognizes me now. Billy, tell your mother we
are the best of friends, won’t you?”</p>

<p>Billy held out a hand toward him, which Mr.
Nocker instantly pounced upon and gripped. Dick
experienced a queer sensation when he saw the
deacon actually bend his head and press several
eager kisses on that little member.</p>

<p>“Shucks! it’s nearly too soft a snap!” Leslie was
muttering in the ear of his chum. “Why, he’d get
down on his knees to beg her to come to him,
Dick.”</p>

<p>“Shut up, can’t you?” hissed the other, not daring
to remove his gaze from the exciting little
tableau for even a single second. “Watch and
see what happens next. There’s many a slip, you
know, when you think everything dead sure!”</p>

<p>“Huh! I guess he’s landed, all right,” chuckled
Leslie. “Look at him fairly ready to eat the little
chap, will you?”</p>

<p>The deacon was speaking again now, and certainly
no one in all Cliffwood had ever heard him
utter such pleading phrases; for as a rule he had
been apt to storm and complain.</p>

<p>“I have a large and comfortable house,
madam,” he told Tilly; “and it has been very dark
and gloomy for a long time now. Pity a lonely
old man, please, and let a ray of sunshine come
into my life. Allow me to offer you a home, just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
as long as you would care to stay; and the presence
of little Billy would repay me a thousand fold.
Say you will come, I beg of you, for my sake, for
Billy’s sake!”</p>

<p>Of course, that was the widow’s chance; and
bravely did she rise to the occasion.</p>

<p>“I thank you, sir, for your kind offer of hospitality,”
she told him, “but I could never accept without
explaining something that evidently you have
never suspected. If I do come to your house, Mr.
Nocker, it must be at your earnest request after I
have told you that I am the widow of your son,
and that this little darling I hold in my arms is
Amos’ own boy, Billy!”</p>

<small>THE DEACON SURRENDERS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Mrs. Nocker said this, both the boys
fastened their eyes on the old deacon, knowing
what a severe shock the news must be to him. He
stared hard at the young woman as though the
staggering truth found some difficulty in penetrating
his mind.</p>

<p>“Billy—you, his mother, belonging to my son
Amos. I surely must be dreaming, girl! Why,
that would give the child to me—his grandfather!”</p>

<p>Mr. Nocker jerked these fragments of sentences
out as though trying hard to comprehend it all.
His gaze wandered from the eager and pretty face
of Tilly to the little fellow held in her arms.</p>

<p>“No, sir, Billy belongs to <i>me</i>, and nothing can
separate him from his own mother,” she told him
plainly. “Where I go he goes too; where Amos’
wife is not welcome, Billy can never find a home,
sir. That would be as Amos must have wished if
he had lived.”</p>

<p>The deacon saw the point. He knew that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
had been worsted in the game, and perhaps, to tell
the truth, the old man was not sorry, because he
had been engaged in a losing fight for a long while,
struggling against his better nature.</p>

<p>“That was a clincher!” muttered Dick, exultantly.</p>

<p>“You just bet it was,” said Leslie, under his
breath. “Look at the way he fixes his eyes on
Billy, will you? There, the little chap is holding
out both hands to his grandfather. Can he resist
that, do you think? Well, I guess nixey.”</p>

<p>Indeed, a grim smile was spreading over the
strong features of Deacon Nocker. He was a man
who had seldom been beaten in any business enterprise
that had engaged his attention, so that
the sensation of losing was no doubt rather novel
to him. Strange to say, he acted as if he rather
enjoyed it. To yield to such an antagonist as little
Billy brought pleasure in its train.</p>

<p>He opened wide his arms, and gathered both
mother and child in his embrace. And some of
the good people of Cliffwood, standing respectfully
near by, including Mr. Holwell, the minister,
believed they saw Deacon Nocker shedding tears
for the first time on record; but they were tears of
joy.</p>

<p>Dick heaved a great sigh of relief.</p>

<p>“It’s all over but the shouting,” said Leslie,
with one hand shielding his eyes from the dazzling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
light of the burning house; though Dick knew very
well there was another reason for his doing this,
because Leslie had a tender heart.</p>

<p>“And,” said a voice close to the two boys, “I
want to congratulate you both on the splendid success
of your grand scheme. I was telling Mrs.
Holwell this very evening, as we sat in my study
after supper, that I really began to see a great
change coming over our old friend here. The secret
is plainly revealed; his love for little Billy
has worked wonders in his heart.”</p>

<p>In fact, Mr. Nocker looked supremely happy as
he stood there with his new-found treasures held
tight in his arms. He even deigned to kiss Tilly
several times, as though already he had found out
his mistake in refusing to see her at the time he
wrote that cruel letter.</p>

<p>“You will never be separated from Billy while
I live,” he was telling her. “My house is big and
contains many costly things but when this manly
little chap comes to bring sunshine into my lonely
life it will hold the greatest treasure of all.”</p>

<p>“Those words do you credit, Deacon Nocker,”
said Mr. Holwell, unable to resist letting the old
man know how he appreciated his change of heart.</p>

<p>“Ah! are you there, sir?” exclaimed the other,
reaching out a hand to the good man. “Then let
me publicly say this: I made one terrible mistake
in my life in trying to raise my boy by rod and rule<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
alone. Please Heaven, with this dear grandchild,
love is going to enter into the scheme. This confession
is the only poor expiation I can make to poor
Amos.”</p>

<p>He suddenly seemed to remember the two boys,
for turning to Dick he went on to say:</p>

<p>“What do I not owe you, Dick Horner, and
Leslie Capes, for your gallant conduct in saving
these dear ones from a cruel death? After this
hour I shall see boys in a different light from the
past. Oh! I have been blind and foolish, wilfully
so, but the boys of Cliffwood will never have occasion
to look upon Jed Nocker as their enemy
after this. I am a changed man.”</p>

<p>He shook their hands almost fiercely. Indeed,
Leslie writhed under the pressure of those, bony
digits of the excited deacon, and rubbed his crushed
fingers for several minutes afterwards. This was
the more singular because hitherto Mr. Nocker
had been one of those cold men whose hand was
apt to feel flabby when extended in greeting. He
was certainly a changed man.</p>

<p>“I wonder what he’ll say,” remarked Leslie, a
little later, as they stood and watched the fire laddies
work like troopers in trying to save a part of
the burning structure, “when they tell him what a
big deal you engineered, Dick.”</p>

<p>“As how?” demanded the other, though doubtless
he could give a pretty good guess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>“Why, about setting up Tilly in housekeeping in
the old Brandon place, just so Billy could wander
over, and get a grip on his granddaddy’s affections,”
explained Leslie, with a chuckle.</p>

<p>“Oh! as far as that goes,” said Dick, instantly,
with his usual generosity, “it strikes me a fellow
named Leslie Capes is about as deep in the mire
as I am in the mud.”</p>

<p>“Get out!” scoffed the other, indignantly.
“Didn’t your mother send for Tilly to come to her
house; and wasn’t this scheme pretty much your
invention?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” admitted Dick, “but how about the way
you joined in with me? Tell me what I could have
done without your help? Didn’t you interest your
Uncle Henry in the game, so as to make him put
up all the money needed to hire this house for Tilly
and her boy, so they could be right next door to
Mr. Nocker?”</p>

<p>Leslie laughed. To tell the truth it pleased the
boy to know that Dick considered him a worthy
partner. And it was just like Dick to want to
share and share alike with a chum, no matter if
he himself had done most of the work.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the greedy flames fought hard to
eat up the rest of the house, and as there was
difficulty in getting a sufficient supply of water for
the fire engine, at times it looked as though only
a heap of ruins would be left.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>Hen Hess, the blacksmith, who acted as foreman
to the volunteer department, knew how to go
about blocking the progress of the flames, however,
and the wind changing helped him considerably.</p>

<p>Inside of half an hour, by furious work, the
gallant fire-fighters had managed to head off the
flames, and it looked as though the front half of
the house might be saved.</p>

<p>“I heard one man say the old rookery was insured
for almost its full value, anyway,” Dick told
several of the boys who stood there with him;
“so the owner isn’t going to lose much.”</p>

<p>“Mebbe he’ll take advantage of the opportunity
to put up a decent modern building on the
grounds,” suggested Elmer Jones.</p>

<p>“I heard Mr. Nocker say he had a good notion
to buy the place in,” remarked Phil Harkness.
“He even laughed when he explained that his family
was getting so big now he would want more
ground; and then Billy had kind of got used to
this Brandon place too. Say, I have to rub my
eyes when I hear that man laugh as he does now.”</p>

<p>“Sure thing,” echoed Peg Fosdick. “Why, before
this it used to make me shiver to hear him
chuckle; but now he shakes all over. And would
you believe it, he actually turned and grabbed
hands with me when I stumbled into him by accident.
Whee! the old world must be coming to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
an end when Jed Nocker’ll do such a thing as
that.”</p>

<p>Dick found himself yawning. Now that all the
excitement had died down, and the three people
in whom he was so deeply interested had gone over
to the Nocker house, with the fire also well under
control, the boy was feeling a reaction setting in.</p>

<p>“Me for home and my comfy bed!” said Leslie,
also gaping in sympathy. “If you feel of the
same mind, Dick, let’s be trotting along.”</p>

<p>Accordingly, they turned their backs on the
smouldering fire, where the volunteer department
still worked industriously. On the way home it
was only natural that the two chums should discuss
the late occurrence, and its successful ending.</p>

<p>“Tilly looked happy enough,” Leslie was remarking
as they stood for a minute on the corner
where their roads separated, both somehow a little
loath to say good night.</p>

<p>“Well, why shouldn’t she?” laughed Dick, happily.
“The future of Billy was made certain, and
with old Mr. Nocker as changed as he is, any little
mother might be glad to have him for a father-in-law.
I’m wild to tell my folks all about it.
Mother will be so delighted, I know.”</p>

<p>“And wasn’t Mr. Holwell pleased, too?” continued
Leslie, reflectively. “I guess he hardly understands
what has happened to crabbed Deacon
Nocker.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>“Oh! yes he does,” stoutly asserted Dick. “Mr.
Holwell makes a study of human nature. He
knows boys from the ground up, and sour old men
as well. He told mother that love alone could
redeem Jed Nocker.”</p>

<p>“And I reckon it has,” asserted Leslie.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Dick, as the other turned away,
“I’m right glad I’ve got that thing out of my system,
anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Leslie called back over his shoulder,
“and now the next job on hand that is going to take
up <i>my</i> attention is to investigate a certain gentleman
who bears some earmarks of being an impostor.
Never mind answering back, Dick. Good
night!”</p>

<small>THE BOYS’ LIBRARY</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Hello</span>! Peg! on your way to the club room?”
asked Dick, several evenings later, as he overtook
the other on the road about half-past seven.</p>

<p>“Just what I am, Dick,” replied the other, in a
joyous fashion. “Tonight our new circulating library
is going to be open to members for the first
time. You know I was elected chief librarian,
though in turn every fellow will have a chance to
serve.”</p>

<p>“You’ve been working pretty hard on it, I understand,
Peg?” continued Dick.</p>

<p>“I guess I have,” chuckled the other, in a
pleased way. “I always put a lot of vim in anything
I tackle. My dad says what’s worth doing
at all is worth doing well, and I’m bound to keep
that rule before me. I’ve hustled to gather up all
the books that were offered for a starter.”</p>

<p>“How many have you on the shelves now, Peg?”</p>

<p>“Seventy-seven, and more promised,” explained
the young librarian. “Besides, we are going to
make out a list of thirty new ones that Mr. Holwell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
approves, and Leslie’s Uncle Henry says he
will foot the bill.”</p>

<p>“That sounds great!” declared Dick; “and I’m
glad for one you had that idea come to you. I
wonder what Mr. Loft over at the Free Library
thinks of this new scheme?”</p>

<p>“I heard that he sniffed some when he first
heard of it. But after Mr. Holwell had a heart-to-heart
talk with him, Mr. Loft seems to have
drawn in his horns. Between you and me I think
he’s seeing a new light. Mebbe he’s beginning to
be afraid this may be the entering wedge that will
lose him his nice job sooner or later.”</p>

<p>“I’d be sorry to hear that,” observed Dick.
“Mr. Loft belongs to the Puritan days when a
man didn’t dare kiss his wife on a Sunday. He
ought to wake up and understand that this is the
twentieth century, not the seventeenth.”</p>

<p>“I agree with you there,” said Peg, heartily.
“And it may be Mr. Loft will learn something.
It’s never too late for that, you know, Dick.”</p>

<p>“Guess you’re right,” admitted the other. “The
case of Deacon Nocker proves it. He’s turned
over a new leaf, let me tell you. Mrs. Nocker says
he’s as kind as anything could be, and that both she
and Billy are happy the livelong day.”</p>

<p>The boys reached the building which had been
turned over to the Y. M. C. A. as headquarters.
It was well lighted up, for like most enterprising<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
towns of its size, Cliffwood boasted of an electric
plant, as well as gas-works and a water supply.</p>

<p>A number of boys were in the main room, chatting,
and waiting for others to come. Later on
they expected to listen to a lecture by a gentleman
who had been with Commander Peary in the
frozen North, and had a deeply interesting story
to tell, illustrated by moving pictures of the ice
and snow regions.</p>

<p>“Here’s Peg, our fine librarian!” announced
one fellow as the pair entered. “Now we can see
what he’s been doing about that new circulating library
of the Y. M. C. A. boys of Cliffwood.”</p>

<p>“Yes, get out your key, Peg, and open the door
to the little room off here,” begged a second impatient
member.</p>

<p>“Just what I mean to do, fellows,” announced
Peg, smiling with pleasure. “Now, don’t rub it in
too hard if things are not up to the standard.
Given a little more time and I promise you it will
look better.”</p>

<p>When the door was opened and they trooped in,
almost filling the small room that had been handed
over to them for the Boys’ Library, they found
that several shelves were filled with books. Every
one of these volumes had its own jacket made of
some smooth, tough brown paper, with the title
carefully printed on the back, as well as the name
of the author.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>On the little desk were several books in which
a record could be kept concerning each and every
book taken out. Peg had taken advice from older
heads—Mr. Holwell among the rest—and nothing
was to be left to chance. Peg was always a great
hand for system, and enjoyed having an opportunity
to put a few pet theories of his into practice.</p>

<p>“You see,” explained the proud librarian,
“every book here has been approved by Mr. Holwell,
who has made a study of juvenile literature.
He knows as well as anything that boys can’t be
<i>forced</i> to read books they don’t like; and so he
says the only way is to give them books with
enough healthful adventure to make them want to
read, and with the right kind of uplifting sentiment
mixed in to leaven the dough.”</p>

<p>“That’s the ticket,” asserted Clint Babbett, energetically.
“If you want to wean boys from reading
stories full of blood and thunder you’ve got
to give them a substitute that will hold them, and
yet not do any harm. Boys are queer animals,
my father always says, and not one man in fifty
really understands how to handle ’em. And as to
women, huh, I reckon none of ’em do, after a boy
gets ten years old.”</p>

<p>“I like the way Mr. Holwell explains his theory
of handling boys reading,” said Dick. “He likens
it to playing doctor, and giving the patient homeopathic
sugar coated pills that contain the medicine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
wanted. It pleases, and does good at the
same time.”</p>

<p>“Another thing,” Peg went on to say, proudly,
“every one of these volumes is as clean as new, almost.
When you take one home with you it’s nice
to know it didn’t come last from a house where
they had the measles, or the scarlet fever. You
see how myself, and a couple of girls who helped
me, covered the whole lot.”</p>

<p>“You deserve a bunch of thanks from the boys
of the Y. M. C. A., Peg,” said Clint.</p>

<p>“And we will see that he gets it, too,” asserted
Dick.</p>

<p>Others coming in just then, the conversation became
more general, Peg being constrained to explain
his system for keeping track of every book
taken out by any member of the Boys’ Club.</p>

<p>“And say,” he told them impressively, “just look
over these iron-bound rules we have written here
on this wall chart. You’ll see there is no fee asked
for taking out a book, but if it’s held over three
days there’s a penalty of a cent a day to pay. Also,
if any book comes back in a bad condition the one
who’s responsible will have to make good.”</p>

<p>“That’s only fair,” remarked Leslie Capes.
“Those of us who have given over some of our
private books to boost the new Boys’ Library along
want to feel that our interest is going to be protected.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>A little while later it chanced that Peg, Dick
and Leslie were sitting together, for no books
could be taken out until the next meeting night, as
the arrangements had not as yet been quite completed.</p>

<p>“I wanted to see you on the sly, Dick, for a minute
or two,” remarked Peg, laying a hand affectionately
on the sleeve of the other.</p>

<p>“Does that mean for me to skip out?” asked
Leslie, quickly.</p>

<p>“Oh! don’t bother about that,” Peg remarked,
easily. “It isn’t anything so very secret, and you
can hear as well as Dick. You see it’s about that
prize Mr. Holwell has offered.”</p>

<p>Of course Dick was immediately deeply interested.
He also felt a quiver pass over him as of
apprehension, though just why this should be he
could hardly have explained if asked.</p>

<p>“Go on and tell us, Peg,” he pleaded.</p>

<p>“In the first place I want you to know I didn’t
mean to spy on Nat, because I’m not that kind, and
besides, it wasn’t any of my business,” Peg started
in to say. “I happened to be sitting on that bench
in the school grounds that stands behind the big
tree, fixing my shoelace that had broken, when Nat
came along with his arm through Dit’s, and what
did they do but stand close by me, with Nat reading
some new stuff he’d just got up, he said, to add
to his farce.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>“Oh!” was what Dick said, though his eyes
flashed with interest. “Don’t tell me what it was
like, Peg, because somehow it might get me started
along the same line. Of course though, you can
tell what you thought of it, for I’d like to know.”</p>

<p>“I hate to say it the worst way, Dick.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that it sounded <i>good</i> to you,
then?” asked Dick, bravely.</p>

<p>“I never heard anything funnier than the stuff
Nat got off,” replied Peg, with a grin he could not
repress.</p>

<p>Dick and Leslie exchanged glances, the one full
of encouragement, the other rather dubious.
When Dit Hennesy said he thought Nat’s farce
was going to “bring the house down” it was bad
enough; but then he was Nat’s crony, and might
be expected to stand up for the other. Now that
Peg, a good friend of Dick’s, added his unqualified
approval it looked indeed serious.</p>

<p>“It must have been pretty good stuff then,” said
Leslie, grimly; “if it made you double up like that,
Peg.”</p>

<p>“It was certainly the greatest thing I ever
heard,” confessed Peg. “If that is original with
Nat then he’s sure got a heap more in that big
head of his than anybody in Cliffwood ever
dreamed he had. I’m sorry, Dick, it’s running that
way, but I thought it my duty to tell you.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII<br>

<small>DID UNCLE SILAS’ EARS BURN?</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick</span> braced himself. Not for worlds did he
want these chums of his to see how badly he felt
at hearing such lavish praise for the effort of his
foremost rival. He wanted that golden prize, and
would be deeply disappointed if he failed to capture
it. But his pride made him laugh now, and
assume an indifferent air.</p>

<p>“Oh! don’t worry about me, Peg,” he told the
other, hastily. “I’m doing my little best, but if
Nat is a genius in that line, why, I suppose I’ll
have to knuckle down and take my medicine, that’s
all. I hope I’ve got grit enough for that.”</p>

<p>“And you won’t think of giving up, will you,
Dick?” asked Leslie, anxiously.</p>

<p>“I was getting a little weak-kneed a while back,”
admitted the other, frankly; “but since then I seem
to have got my second wind. No-siree, I’ll fight
it out on this line if it takes all winter. And say,
if I do get knocked out you’ll see my ship going
down with her colors flying. Hear that?”</p>

<p>“Bully for you, Dick!” ejaculated Peg, slapping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
him on the back as he arose to go to some other
part of the big room. It was now filling up with
older fellows and some of the town people who
wanted to hear the lecture.</p>

<p>Dick and Leslie continued to sit there. Others
were constantly passing one way or another,
but paying no particular attention to the two boys;
so they did not hesitate to continue their conversation
as they saw fit.</p>

<p>“I’m glad you feel that way about keeping in
the fight to the end, Dick,” Leslie went on to say.</p>

<p>“What else can I do, now that every fellow
knows I’ve entered for the prize?” demanded
Dick. “I’m not the one to give up easily, you understand.
My mother seems to think a heap of
what I’ve done so far on that farce, and I’ve just
<i>got</i> to finish the same, no matter if it comes in the
last of the string.”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s no fear of that!” declared Leslie,
positively. “I’ve heard enough of it to say it’s
just bully stuff.”</p>

<p>“Oh! that’s nice of you to say so,” laughed Dick,
a little harshly; “but then you’re my chum, and naturally
prejudiced. I thought the same when Dit
told how great Nat’s stuff was; but now that Peg
has endorsed it too, there must be something in
the thing. But I won’t allow myself to get discouraged,
I promise you that, Leslie. Now, let’s
change the subject again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>“All right, Dick. How are things going over
at your house nowadays—of course, I mean with
your wonderful prodigal Uncle Silas, who spent
his life knocking around the world having a good
time, and when old age and sickness overtook him
suddenly remembered that he had a sister somewhere,
and hunted her up so she could take care
of him?”</p>

<p>Leslie spoke pretty bitterly, because this was
a sore subject with him. On the other hand, Dick
shook his head as though in disapproval of such
radical views.</p>

<p>“I’d rather you didn’t say such things to me, you
know, old fellow,” he told his chum.</p>

<p>“But sure you must be suspecting something like
that deep down in your own heart, Dick!” protested
Leslie, earnestly.</p>

<p>“I don’t let myself think of poor old Uncle
Silas that way,” said Dick, firmly. “He’s told us
a whole lot of his struggles, and how often he
thought he had his hand on a big fortune, only to
get fooled time and again. And he always says
that the one thing he thought of was to hunt his
young sister up, if she still lived, and provide for
her if fortune was kind to him.”</p>

<p>Leslie gave an incredulous snort at hearing Dick
say that.</p>

<p>“Bah! that’s a clever little yarn he’s gotten up
to pull the wool over your eyes,” he went on to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
say, indignantly. “If he ever had struck it rich,
none of you’d ever’ve heard from him. Like as
not he’d have gone in for a big time. But after he
began to feel old age and sickness gripping him,
of course he wanted to hunt Sister Polly up, and
spin a tale of hard luck.”</p>

<p>“Well, I reckon you and I will never agree on
that subject, Leslie.”</p>

<p>“I’m really surprised at you being taken in and
fooled so easy, Dick.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it’s just as you say,” continued the
other, “but there’s something about old Uncle
Silas that seems to appeal to me. I like the look
in his mild blue eyes. He may have been an adventurer
all his life, but for all that, Leslie, let
me tell you he’s a lovable old fellow, say what you
will.”</p>

<p>“Whee! he certainly has cast a spell over you
folks for a fact!” declared the other, shrugging
his shoulders as though almost ready to despair
of Dick.</p>

<p>“I guess he has,” admitted Dick, “for mother
has taken to him even more than I have. And as
for grandpop, he loves to sit and listen to Uncle
Silas telling of the dozens and dozens of strange
things he’s run across.”</p>

<p>“Birds of a feather flock together, they say,
Dick,” chuckled Leslie; “and now your fine old
grandfather can exchange stories with another who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
has seen a lot of lively times. But for all you say,
I still hang on to my suspicions, and believe he’s
either an impostor, not your uncle at all, or else
that he’s just bent on settling down on your folks
to be fed and housed for the rest of his natural
life.”</p>

<p>“All you can say isn’t going to convince me,”
Dick told him. “Once or twice in the beginning I
admit I did begin to lean that way, but I’ve been
ashamed of feeling suspicious.”</p>

<p>“Oh! well, let it pass,” ventured Leslie.
“‘Where ignorance is bliss, ’tis folly to be wise,’
they say; and if you’re happy in believing all that
old chap stuffs into your ears why keep on being
so, Dick. Only, as your friend, I’ve felt it my duty
to warn you, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“If you want to find guilt it’s easy to explain
every look or chuckle or action that way,” Dick
went on. “As for me I have come to put considerable
confidence in Uncle Silas. I’m awful sorry
he’s had such hard luck; and I feel sure he won’t
think of staying with us right along, so as to be a
burden.”</p>

<p>“But I heard your mother say only a few days
ago, Dick, that if only she had a little more ready
cash to meet expenses, he should never quit her
house.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” quickly asserted the other,
proudly. “Her heart is as big as a bushel basket.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
It’s one of the Horner traits, or weak points, I
guess.”</p>

<p>“Sure, and you’re a Horner in the bargain,”
said Leslie.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I am,” laughed the other boy. “But
if this little affair would only turn out half as well
as the other one did—about Mrs. Nocker and her
boy, I mean, it’d be just bunkum.”</p>

<p>“No danger of that happening, believe me.”</p>

<p>“Did I hear you say the books ordered by your
Uncle Henry had come, Leslie?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, we got notice this evening that there
was a big box for us down at the railroad freight
house, and it must be the books, Dick.”</p>

<p>“Our library will look pretty fine once they’re in
place,” remarked Dick; “and the more I get to
thinking about Peg’s scheme the better I like it.
Let me tell you the boys of Cliffwood will owe a
lot to that uncle of yours, Leslie.”</p>

<p>“He’s the right kind of an uncle to have,”
boasted the other, boy-like.</p>

<p>Just then Leslie turned around, and was immediately
heard to give a low exclamation that
caught the attention of his chum.</p>

<p>“What is it?” demanded Dick, himself turning
to look.</p>

<p>The room was beginning to fill up with all manner
of people, and many the boys knew, young and
old, were moving about.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>“Why, would you believe it!” snapped Leslie,
“the miserable old humbug was sitting right behind
us all the while?”</p>

<p>“Do you mean my Uncle Silas?” asked Dick,
uneasily.</p>

<p>“Did you know he expected to come over and
listen to the lecture tonight?” continued the other
boy.</p>

<p>“He asked me some questions about it at the
supper table,” explained Dick, “and whether an
admission fee was to be charged those who were
not members of the Y. M. C. A., but so far as I
remember, Uncle Silas didn’t say anything about
meaning to attend.”</p>

<p>“Well, he’s here all right. And say, I bet you
he heard every word we said, if he’s got any ears
at all. He just couldn’t have helped it, Dick.”</p>

<p>Dick smiled.</p>

<p>“So far as I’m concerned, Leslie, I’ve no reason
to be ashamed of anything I said. I’m only sorry
if he heard you speak of him being an impostor
and a fraud. Uncle Silas is pretty sensitive, I’ve
found out. I hope it won’t cause him to make up
his mind to leave us in a hurry, thinking he’s a burden.
What little he eats doesn’t amount to much,
and he sure has made both my mother and grandfather
happier since he dropped in among us.”</p>

<p>Leslie looked hard at his chum, and shook his
head in abject despair.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII<br>

<small>THE LURE OF THE STEEL RUNNERS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> lecture was a huge success. Those who
were fortunate enough to be present gave a vote of
thanks to the committee that had been energetic
enough to procure the services of the famous Arctic
explorer without any cost to the association.</p>

<p>Even such restless fellows as Nat and Dit sat
spellbound while the gentleman told of the wonderful
things he had seen amidst the polar ice;
and they held their breath with awe when he described
the dangers he and his daring comrades
had faced at the time they found themselves lost in
the frozen wastes.</p>

<p>For several days afterwards it was a matter of
congratulation among the boys belonging to the
Junior Department that they were given an opportunity
to hear such treats through the coming
winter season.</p>

<p>Of course, there were other meetings, of a
purely religious nature—meetings usually led by
strong, vigorous Y. M. C. A. leaders who knew exactly
how to talk to boys and influence them for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
good. These meetings were usually well attended,
and often prompted some wayward lad to “get a
grip on himself” as Harry Bartlett expressed it,
and turn over a new leaf.</p>

<p>“It was a lucky thing for us Mr. Holwell
thought up this scheme of his,” Leslie was saying
on Saturday morning, as with several other fellows
he shied stones on to the new ice that had
formed over the big pond where the first skating
was always done, to see if it was likely soon to bear
a fellow’s weight.</p>

<p>So eager were the boys of Cliffwood to get on
their skates that hardly a season went by without
a number of minor casualties, when the thin ice
gave way, and precipitated the daring leader into
the pond.</p>

<p>Once, several years back, a boy had actually
been drowned here, but that event was by degrees
being forgotten, and some of the fellows once
more began to evince the old-time rashness about
taking chances.</p>

<p>“Hardly a day passes,” Andy Hale went on to
say, “but what some new fellows tell me they are
thinking of handing in their names, with the intention
of joining the Boys’ Club.”</p>

<p>“First come, first served,” chimed in Peg Fosdick.
“Our number has to be limited, because the
house can’t hold a great many more than belong
now. That’s what I tell everybody.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>“I’ve got a good notion to try that ice!” Fred
Bonnicastle told them as he sat on a friendly log
and commenced to fit his skates.</p>

<p>Possibly Fred was more passionately fond of
skating than any fellow in Cliffwood. He would
walk five miles willingly for a chance to spin
around, and for several years now had been the
first to try the new ice.</p>

<p>“Better go a little slow about that, Freddy,”
cautioned Leslie. “Of course, we all know new ice
can stand a heap more than when it gets punk and
rotten from thaws; but even then unless you skip
along pretty fast you’re apt to break through.”</p>

<p>“And the pond is higher than ever this year,
don’t forget, which means more room to paddle in
if you do break through,” he was warned by Peg.</p>

<p>“You never knew me to get caught yet,” laughed
the other, who had a stubborn streak in his makeup.
“The secret of my success has been the swallow
way I dart around. The new ice will bend
like india-rubber, but before it can think of cracking,
shucks! I’m away off, and still going.”</p>

<p>“There comes Dick, and from the grin on his
face I’d like to wager a cookey he’s just half tickled
to death over something,” ventured Leslie, whose
quick eye had detected his chum’s approach.</p>

<p>Dick had his skates suspended by a strap over
his shoulder. Perhaps he did not really expect to
have a chance to use them, but then it always made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
him feel hopeful to get them out for the first time
of a crisp winter morning.</p>

<p>“What’s happened, Dick?” demanded one of
the boys, as the other came up.</p>

<p>“You look as happy as pie,” remarked Peg;
“has some kind relative gone to a better country,
and left you his little fortune?”</p>

<p>“Oh! it only means that a great big load has
been lifted from my shoulders, that’s all,” Dick
told them.</p>

<p>“I know what he means, fellows!” sang out Leslie.
“He’s finished that farce of his at last. Bully
for you, Dick; I knew you’d stick everlastingly at
it till the thing was done. And I hope you let us
hear it from beginning to end.”</p>

<p>“I handed it over to the committee this very
morning,” announced Dick. “The time limit expires
on Monday, you know. They said all of the
entries were in but two, and from what I’ve heard
about Toby and Frank I’m afraid they backed out
after making a try.”</p>

<p>“But that’s too bad,” expostulated Peg, “because
we all hoped to hear you read your farce before
the committee decided on the winner.”</p>

<p>Dick laughed, a little harshly it must be confessed.</p>

<p>“Well, as I’ve got a copy of it you may have
that great pleasure still,” he told them. “Perhaps
it’s the only chance you’ll ever get, for I reckon my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
effort isn’t going to set the river on fire; and I’ve
been hearing wonderful stories about another
farce, which I expect will walk around my poor attempt.”</p>

<p>Most of Dick’s chums had heard more or less
of the same thing, for Dit Hennesy and Alonzo
Crane had taken considerable pleasure in boasting
what a “screamer” Nat’s effusion was going to be.</p>

<p>Still Peg and Elmer and the rest of them were
loyal to Dick. They had seen him gain the goal
many times in races and games, even when the odds
were against him; and fully believed he must come
again under the line first.</p>

<p>“Talk never wins a race, Dick,” said Leslie.</p>

<p>“And lots of fellows do their shouting before
the end,” remarked Peg. “I’m banking on you to
cop that prize, no matter what Nat says.”</p>

<p>“And remember,” added Elmer, “you’ve as
good as promised to let us hear the sketch from
beginning to end at the first favorable opportunity.”</p>

<p>“It’s kind of you to want to hear it, that’s all
I’ve got to say,” laughed the author. “Anyhow,
a load is lifted off my shoulders. Good or bad, it’s
got to stand. I’m through bothering over it. If
Nat’s done something that throws mine in the
shade, all right. I’ll have to grin and bear it. And
now, please let up on that subject. I want to forget
it for a while.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>“Well, here goes!” announced Fred Bonnicastle,
as he rose to his feet.</p>

<p>“Are you really meaning to make a test of the
ice, Fred?” asked Dick, dubiously. “It looks
mighty thin to me, and I can see several places
where the big rocks that have been dropped on
the same have broken through.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I’m a wonder when it comes to skimming
over thin ice,” boasted the other, really anxious to
keep up to his reputation for recklessness, and once
more open the season as the first to try his skates.</p>

<p>“Better keep near the shore, then,” advised Leslie.
“If you do break through you will only be up
to your waist, and can wade out.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry!” scoffed Fred, as he balanced
himself on one skate at the edge, and took a quick
survey of the big pond, as though deciding upon
his course, “I can swim if it comes to it, you know.
And somebody has got to be the first to do stunts
on the new ice.”</p>

<p>With that he suddenly darted away.</p>

<p>“Whee! listen to it crack, will you?” exclaimed
Peg.</p>

<p>“Oh! new ice always does that,” asserted Leslie.
“I like to hear it snap on a frosty morning
like this. But say, you can see it bend like anything
under his weight. I don’t believe I care to
try it yet awhile. I’m more hefty in weight than
Fred, and never could whip along like he does.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>The venturesome skater was going with the
speed of the wind, and thus far he had kept within
a reasonable distance from the shore. Apparently,
he meant to go completely around the pond,
leaving the white marks of his sharp runners on the
clear ice, to prove himself the first on skates for
the season.</p>

<p>“Just as fine as silk, fellows!” he called out as
he approached the group. “Some of the rest of
you had better take a spin along with me. Not a
bit of danger if you keep on the jump.”</p>

<p>No one seemed tempted, however. They had
seen how the thin ice gave under Fred as he
went on, and knew that it was only the rapidity of
his flight that kept him from breaking through.
Should one of his skates become loose, so as to delay
his progress, the chances were as ten to one
he must meet with a catastrophe.</p>

<p>“I’m going to take another round!” called out
Fred over his shoulder. “And then watch me cut
straight across the middle of the pond.”</p>

<p>“I guess he means that, too!” declared Leslie,
uneasily. “Fred gets more reckless every year.
I’m afraid something will happen to him yet.”</p>

<p>“It’s a good thing,” observed Dick, who had
been looking around meanwhile, “that there’s a
heap of old boards lying right close by, taken from
that high fence. If he does break through we’ll
need the same, you can just believe.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>“Why, it’s ten feet deep out in the middle!” asserted
Peg.</p>

<p>“And the further he goes away from the shore
the more the sheet of ice is bound to bend under
him,” said Elmer. “If he keeps his word every
fellow fasten to one of the boards, and be ready to
shove it out.”</p>

<p>“He never could climb up on that thin ice, once
his clothes get soaked,” Dick continued, “and before
he could break his way to shore he’d be exhausted.”</p>

<p>The skater soon came around again, going very
fast. He waved a hand flippantly to his friends on
the shore, and changing his course suddenly darted
directly out toward the middle of the big pond.</p>

<p>The other boys ran to the pile of boards, and
each picked one of the planks up. Hardly had they
done this than there was a shout of alarm, a crash,
and a splash, and reckless Fred Bonnicastle had
vanished from sight!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIV<br>

<small>A LESSON IN LIFE SAVING</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Oh</span>! Fred’s broken in!” shouted Peg Fosdick,
in alarm.</p>

<p>“And right in the middle of the pond, too!”
echoed Leslie.</p>

<p>“Get busy!” roared Dick, who had been holding
himself in readiness for just such an emergency
from the moment he had heard the reckless skater
announce his intention of skimming across the
pond from shore to shore.</p>

<p>Dick had his little plan of campaign all mapped
out in his mind. He had a happy faculty for this
sort of thing. In a flash he could grasp details that
would have taken some other fellows a minute or
two to figure out.</p>

<p>“Fetch the boards along in a hurry!” he shouted
over his shoulder, for by that time he was fully
under way.</p>

<p>Straight to the nearest point of the shore line
he rushed and dropped his plank. It extended out
on the ice in a bee-line for the spot where poor
Fred was splashing and scrambling like mad, trying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
in his excitement to climb up on the ice, only
to have it break away, and precipitate him again
into the cold water.</p>

<p>Dick took the second board from Leslie, who
was the first of the others to arrive.</p>

<p>“Go back and get another!” he told his chum
sharply, taking it upon himself to act as the leader.
His chums were so accustomed to seeing Dick in
the van that no one ever dreamed of questioning
his right to act in that capacity. “We’ll need a
heap of ’em, I’m afraid,” he added.</p>

<p>So Leslie obediently whirled on his heel and hurried
back to the pile. Dick took the plank Elmer
offered him, and stepping out to the end of the second
one dropped it also in a direct line.</p>

<p>Then came Peg, almost forgetting his usual limp
in his anxiety to be of service to the imperiled comrade
battling for his life out there in the middle
of the deep pond. A fourth board was thrown
over the smooth ice so that Dick could reach it
without stepping off his safe harbor; for as his
weight was now distributed over ten or twelve feet
of surface, instead of being concentrated in one
spot, there was no danger of his breaking through.</p>

<p>The boys worked like beavers, Dick handling
the planks as they came along in a master-workman
manner. Gradually but surely the line was
being extended out toward the scene of all the
commotion, where Fred continued to struggle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>While he worked so heroically, Dick did not forget
to keep calling out encouragement to the imperiled
boy.</p>

<p>“Don’t tire yourself out so, Fred!” he told the
other. “It’s all right, and we’re bound to get
you out of there in a jiffy. Just hold on to the ice,
and give us a chance to do something. We’re coming
as sure as anything. Keep a grip on yourself,
and don’t let go the ice for your life, Fred!”</p>

<p>Of course the further Dick got from the shore
the more difficult it was to shove each new plank
out to him. As no one dared step on the ice itself
the boys were compelled to run out over the
board line, deliver their burden, and then make
back to the safety of the shore before the next one
could start.</p>

<p>Two more planks would do the business, the
second to be used sideways so as to afford a landing-stage,
as Dick would have called it.</p>

<p>“Oh! hurry, Dick!” gasped Fred. “I’m mighty
near all in, I tell you!”</p>

<p>“Forget that!” cried Dick, boisterously, and
after that he kept on talking in a cheery manner
to Fred, his intention being to make the other keep
his mind off his condition of utter exhaustion.</p>

<p>The next plank brought him close to the hole
which by this time was a pretty big one, as Fred
had thrashed around furiously in the endeavor to
help himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>“Steady now, old fellow!” said Dick, as he crept
out on his hands and knees, so as to come in touch
with the other, and give him renewed confidence.
“Peg’s fetching the last plank, and we’ll use it
along the edge here, so you can get your knee on
the same. Then I’ll drag, and you’ll shove, and
out you’re going to come as neat as pie. Hurry,
along, Peg, and then stand by to help!”</p>

<p>While saying this, Dick was gripping the chilled
hand of Fred, whose eyes, filled with horror, were
glued appealingly on his face.</p>

<p>“You won’t let me drop back, will you, Dick?”
chattered the other between his rattling teeth, for
the tremendous excitement and the cold water combined
had taken his courage completely away.</p>

<p>“Not much!” asserted the boy who crouched on
the plank. “See, here’s Peg right behind me with
that board. Shove it along so I can place it where
it’s going to do the most good, Peg. There you
are, with a regular landing-stage that won’t break
away when you climb up. Now, brace yourself,
Fred, for a big effort; and you Peg, grip hold of
my coat in the back so as to keep me steady when
I pull!”</p>

<p>The boys clustered on the shore watched with
their hearts in their throats, so to speak, for they
realized that the crisis was at hand.</p>

<p>Dick took a fresh grip on Fred’s hand.</p>

<p>“Up you come, old fellow! Do your level best<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
this time, and it’s going to be all right! That’s the
ticket! Whoop! here you are as safe as could be!”</p>

<p>Loud shouts arose from Leslie and the rest of
the group when they saw the dripping Fred emerge
from the water, and gain a position on the first
plank. The treacherous ice did not break under
his weight because the fence board covered such a
wide section that it was evenly distributed.</p>

<p>“Can you creep along after me, Fred?” demanded
Dick.</p>

<p>“Sure thing!” came the reply, though Fred
could hardly speak on account of the way his teeth
were rattling together.</p>

<p>Of course Dick kept close watch over his
shoulder from time to time as he headed for the
shore; but Fred managed to get to his feet presently,
and hurried along after his rescuer.</p>

<p>He was greeted boisterously by the other fellows.
No one chided him on account of his reckless
act; they were all too full of gratitude over the
rescue to think of “rubbing it in.”</p>

<p>“Now make a bee-line for home as fast as you
can run,” advised Dick, after he and Leslie had
unfastened the skates from Fred’s shoes. “Keep
swinging your arms and coming down hard with
your feet as you run. Hurry, the ice is beginning
to form on your shoes and clothes!”</p>

<p>With that Fred started off on the run. He was
shivering, and still weak from his recent experience,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
and while knowing what a fright it would
give his mother to see him coming home in that
condition, he also understood that he must get into
dry clothes as soon as possible, or suffer serious results.</p>

<p>“Now, if we’d been away off somewhere, with
no house near by,” remarked Leslie, as with the
others he stood and watched Fred gallop homeward;
“we’d have had to build a couple of fires,
and strip Fred so we could rub him down while his
duds were getting dry. But his mother’ll fix him
all right.”</p>

<p>“Whew! what a splash he did make out there!”
exclaimed Peg.</p>

<p>“I’m glad it wasn’t me,” remarked Elmer; “because
I’m afraid my father’d take my skates away
for the rest of the winter. He doesn’t believe in
boys being so reckless.”</p>

<p>“All the same,” Andy Hale went on to say, “I
noticed, Elmer, that you ran out there on the
planks several times, and if the ice had given way
you’d have been as deep in it as Fred.”</p>

<p>“Oh! that was another thing,” replied Elmer.
“It was to save life that I took a chance, and my
father always told me he’d stand for that every
time. I’m not meaning to tell him a word about
this, but he’ll hear from other people. I know
he’ll ask me if I was in the bunch, and did my little
stunt with the rest. I’d hate to tell him I just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
stood by, and never raised a hand to help poor
Fred.”</p>

<p>“All of you deserve the highest praise,” said
Dick. “We worked together, and I’m sure I never
could have got a plank out to Fred before he gave
up the ghost and sank, without your help.”</p>

<p>Of course there was no more temptation for
any of them to make use of their skates.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the party wended its way back to
town, and the news of Fred’s mishap was soon
common talk. Perhaps it might serve to arouse
the authorities to some action looking to forbidding
skating on the big pond until the ice was
considered safe for a crowd.</p>

<p>“How about meeting somewhere this very afternoon,”
suggested Leslie, as they stopped on a corner
before scattering to their various homes.
“Maybe Dick will read his farce to us.”</p>

<p>“A bully idea!” Peg declared, and others immediately
echoed his words.</p>

<p>Dick smiled and shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Seems as if you’re bent on having it,” he said;
“and it proves you a bold lot of chums. Well, I’d
like to know what you think of it, so let’s get together
in the room Leslie has fitted up in their
barn, where he’s a stove handy. I’ll be around at
two o’clock when my chores are done. But don’t
expect too much, please.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV<br>

<small>DICK HAS A SELECT AUDIENCE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Promptly</span> at two o’clock Dick made his appearance
at the Capes’ barn. Leslie had been given
the man’s room, which was vacant, to fit up for a
den. As most boys delight to do, he had the
walls decorated with college banners, and all manner
of things connected with outdoor sports.</p>

<p>It made a cheery place where the boy and his
friends could spend an hour or two in reading or
playing games. As a rule Dick passed considerable
time there in company with his best chum; and
many of their plans of the past had actually been
hatched amidst those congenial surroundings.</p>

<p>Dick found his friends impatiently awaiting his
coming. Besides Leslie, there were Phil, Clint,
Peg, Andy and Elmer sitting or lounging there,
with the little stove making the room very comfortable.</p>

<p>“Here he is, and on time in the bargain!” exclaimed
Andy.</p>

<p>“But with not a minute to spare,” added Clint.
“If it’d been anybody but you, Dick, I’d have begun<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
to think we might be left in the lurch; but
nobody ever knew you to go back on your word.”</p>

<p>“Well, I felt pretty much like crawfishing this
time, I own up,” laughed the latest arrival; “because
it seemed like a whole lot of nerve for me to
come here meaning to impose on you with my poor
stuff.”</p>

<p>“Huh! just let us be the judge of that, won’t
you, Dick?” demanded Leslie. “And say, I’m
glad to see you’ve fetched your old banjo along.”</p>

<p>“Good boy!” cried Elmer; “I take it you’ve
gone and got up some coon songs and choruses,
and mean to let us come in strong on the last
named.”</p>

<p>“That’s a little secret,” laughed Peg, “but it
needn’t be held in any longer. Just the other day
Susie Banks told me how she and Connie Swazy,
the Judge’s pretty daughter, got up the music score
for your words, Dick. And knowing what a fine
musician Connie is I’m wild to hear the combination.”</p>

<p>“Well, all of you find soft spots, so if you drop
flat at hearing some of the excruciating jokes my
end-men get off you won’t be hurt much,” warned
Dick, pretending to be very serious.</p>

<p>“We’re willing to risk all that, Dick,” Peg told
him, confidently.</p>

<p>“One reason why we want to hear your farce,
Dick, if you must know it,” said Elmer, frankly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
“is this: You know we’ve every one of us been
picked out by Mr. Holwell to take part in the minstrel
show those two nights after New Year’s.
Each fellow has some specialty to carry through;
and then some of us are going to take a hand playing
in the black farce, no matter which one wins
the prize.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” added Peg, “and we’ve got a heap of
personal interest in the matter besides. All of
us are banking on you to win that twenty-five dollars
in gold. We’re boosting your claims to beat
the band.”</p>

<p>“Are you all ready, and prepared for the
worst?” asked Dick, as he settled himself comfortably
to read his little farce, on which he had spent
many hours after the rest of the family had retired
to their beds.</p>

<p>“Let her go, Dick; and do your best to bring
out the strong points,” begged Peg.</p>

<p>“When I come to a song,” explained the author,
“I’ll try to give it to you the best way I can, though
better singers are to be chosen to carry the refrain,
and one of them I understand is going to be Peg
here.”</p>

<p>“How about the choruses—we all join in there,
I understand?” demanded Elmer.</p>

<p>“I’ll give you slips of paper with the words of
the chorus printed on them by typewriter,” explained
Dick; “and then play the air, so you can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
follow it. According to my mind the music is
going to be the best part of this black farce.”</p>

<p>“Listen to him, will you?” scoffed Andy Hale.
“Dick says that because the music is the only thing
some one else got up, and Connie Swazy at that.
Of course it’s bound to be good, because that girl
is a regular genius along those lines. But all the
same, there are others. Now get away, Dick.”</p>

<p>If any one had happened to be passing along the
road a little later he must have been deeply puzzled
to account for the hilarious shouts that occasionally
broke out from the Capes’ barn on that
particular Saturday afternoon. Boyish laughter
it surely was, and the listener would have certainly
come to the conclusion that Leslie and some of his
friends were having a royal good time of it there,
no matter what engaged their attention.</p>

<p>They laughed at Dick’s jokes until they were
weak. Then after Dick had twanged his banjo in
his clever fashion, and given them the first stanza
of a coon song, he played the catchy music of the
smashing chorus, after which all of them joined in
with a roar, as they were accustomed to doing with
their familiar school songs.</p>

<p>After the first song had been sung several times,
by request, the boys could not refrain from giving
vent to their enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“That’s as fine a thing as I ever heard!” declared
Elmer, radiantly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>“Words and music are just immense!” said
Andy. “There’s something worth while in the
sentiment too, which counts. So many of these
ragtime things are the silliest stuff going. And say,
Connie did herself proud when she got up that air.
I’ll have to keep watching all the while not to be
humming it, and giving the snap away long before
the time comes.”</p>

<p>The others, too, had words of praise for Dick’s
modest little farce as far as they had heard him
give it.</p>

<p>“Why,” said Andy Hale, seriously, “if it keeps
on like that all the way through, old fellow, it’s
going to make Nat’s effort look like thirty cents, I
wager.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Leslie, who was feeling very happy
to hear them shower all this praise on Dick, “that’s
only a sample of what he’s got up his sleeve. The
best is yet to come. Wait till you hear that ‘Oh!
Susannah’ song and chorus; it’ll make you shake
all over; and then the music is simply great!”</p>

<p>“Shut up, Leslie, can’t you?” admonished Dick.
“You’ll queer me if you get them expecting so
much. Now, if you’ve caught your second wind,
and feel you can stand some more, get ready to
weep!”</p>

<p>Instead of that, they roared the louder. Sometimes
they lay back and shook as if utterly exhausted,
laughing at the comical situations, as well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
as the words Dick put in the mouths of his eight
characters who were supposed to be acting the
farce.</p>

<p>When the second song was reached, they had to
beg Dick to wait a little until they could recover
their breath before breaking into the chorus. And
how they did shout it out in concert, as though
words and music exactly suited their ideas of what
a negro melody should be.</p>

<p>So it went on until the end, when a final scene
brought the house down. A last song completed
the work of the aspiring author. When the boys
had repeated the chorus for the third time, Dick
begged them to halt, and stopped twanging the
strings of his banjo.</p>

<p>“Well, what’s the verdict?” he demanded,
bravely. “Think it’s got a ghost of a show against
Nat’s farce?”</p>

<p>“The fellow who could beat that would have to
sit up all night, and be a genius in the bargain!”
declared Elmer, positively.</p>

<p>“Why, not even a professional song and farce
writer could equal some of the parts you’ve got in
there!” declared Andy Hale. “I have to rub my
eyes and look again to believe you could originate
so much droll stuff. And such fetching songs! As
for Nat, shucks! he’ll never have half a show, believe
me.”</p>

<p>“And the rest of us who dared make a try will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
be in the also-ran class,” chuckled Phil Harkness.</p>

<p>“It was mighty good, and that’s a sure thing,
Dick!”</p>

<p>Dick could not help noticing that it was Peg who
said this. He also remembered how Peg had overheard
Nat reading a part of his farce to one of
his cronies. Peg then was the only person qualified
to judge between the two rival efforts, because
he alone had heard something of each. And Peg
was not as enthusiastic as the rest, for had he not
only said “it was mighty good, Dick?”</p>

<p>That was the fly in the ointment. It seemed to
take away much of the pleasure and confidence that
otherwise Dick must have obtained from hearing
his praises sung so confidently by the rest.</p>

<p>“Now you’ve heard my little farce,” he told
them, “please don’t speak of it to me again. I
want to forget all about it for a while. The committee
will take a week to decide which one they
like best. When we have our next meeting their
decision is going to be announced to the crowd, and
then the agony will be over.”</p>

<p>“Here’s wishing you every success going, Dick!”
cried Peg, with vim.</p>

<p>They slapped Dick on the back, and soon had
him laughing heartily; though when he found himself
alone again he was bound to brood over the
fact that Peg, who had heard a portion of Nat’s effusion,
had simply said Dick’s was good.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>“After all, this minstrel show is going to be only
one thing Mr. Holwell has in mind for the boys of
the Y. M. C. A.,” remarked Clint. “He’s planning
a lot of other affairs for the late winter; and
I heard him say that he hoped when vacation time
came along we might camp out somewhere, and
have a royal good time of it.”</p>

<p>“If we do,” ventured Andy, “I certainly hope he
picks out Russabaga Lake for the trip. I’ve always
wanted to camp on that wonderful Bass Island
that we’ve heard so much about. If I get a
chance I’m going to speak to Mr. Holwell about
it.”</p>

<p>The boys sat around and talked for some little
time, and then some of them having things they
wanted to do started home. When Dick, being the
last to leave, was going, Leslie smacked him on the
back and said cheerily:</p>

<p>“Make no mistake, old fellow, that farce is going
to come under the wire a winner!”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Leslie,” Dick replied, and somehow
this unflinching confidence shown by his dearest
and best chum helped to buoy up his spirits
when doubts again assailed his heart.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVI<br>

<small>BAD NEWS</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Here’s</span> a letter for Grandpop Horner, Dick.
The postman met me at the corner, and I guess he
must have known I was headed for your house
because he just handed it over and asked me to
deliver it.”</p>

<p>Leslie, as he said this, held up the letter in question.
He had met Dick at the gate of the little
Horner cottage, as the latter was about setting out
on some errand.</p>

<p>It was on the afternoon just before Christmas,
and the winter had fully set in. There was a trace
of snow on the ground, and the ice was in excellent
condition for skating. Doubtless many a
young person in Cliffwood, who anticipated receiving
a new pair of skates on the following happy
morning, was hoping that no cloud would come
up to cover the fine sheet on the pond with snow
before they had a chance to break in their cherished
present.</p>

<p>Dick took the letter and looked hard at it.
When he saw it was addressed on a typewriter,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
and that in the upper left-hand corner there was
printed the name of a law firm in New York, somehow
he was seized with a sense of coming trouble.</p>

<p>He knew that his grandfather had his little savings
in a certain enterprise that heretofore had
yielded fair profits. This sum of money, together
with the pension that the Government paid the veteran,
had barely sufficed to keep the wolf from the
door of the Horner home for years.</p>

<p>“I hope it isn’t bad news I’ve fetched you,
Dick?” ventured Leslie, uneasily, for he had seen
that frown gather on the forehead of his chum,
and could give a pretty fair guess as to what caused
it.</p>

<p>“Oh! I hardly think that could be,” replied
Dick, trying to smile cheerily. “With Christmas
coming tomorrow it would be pretty tough for
grandpop to get bad news. I was only going on
a little errand, so I’ll turn back and give it to
him.”</p>

<p>Leslie was almost as much at home in Dick’s
humble dwelling as in his more spacious home; so
he did not hesitate to follow at his chum’s heels
when the other hurried back to the door.</p>

<p>“Here’s a letter for you, Grandpop,” remarked
Dick, as he entered.</p>

<p>The old veteran was sitting by the fire, droning
over his pipe, and the paper which came in the
morning mail. He aroused himself at the information,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
for letters were few and far between at
the Horner home, so that the receipt of one always
caused more or less interest. Mrs. Horner came
in from the kitchen wiping her hands on her apron;
even little Sue ceased playing with her favorite
cat, and looked up expectantly.</p>

<p>Grandpop turned the letter over and over.
Plainly he was a bit afraid to tear it open, for his
aged hands shook visibly, and he could be seen
pressing his lips firmly together as though summoning
all his resolution to the fore.</p>

<p>That imprint of a legal firm dismayed him. His
dealings with lawyers had been few, and perhaps
not of an altogether pleasant nature at that. Finally,
he seemed to reach a point where he could
wait no longer, so he managed to detach a strip
of the envelope.</p>

<p>The enclosure was in typewriting like the address.
All of the others watched grandpop earnestly
as he first rubbed his glasses so as to get a
little more time, and then started in to read the
letter.</p>

<p>Uncle Silas had been lying down on the well-worn
sofa. He sat up and seemed to be deeply
interested. Leslie, as usual, was watching the
wanderer closely; possibly the boy even allowed
himself to wonder whether sly Uncle Silas’ presence
there could have any connection with the
coming of this mysterious missive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>Then grandpop uttered a low groan, though he
tried bravely enough to crush it.</p>

<p>“Oh! what is it all about, Father?” exclaimed
Mrs. Horner, darting forward to put her supporting
arm about the old man, who seemed to waver
in his seat.</p>

<p>The veteran drew his quivering hand caressingly
over her hair several times. He had some
difficulty in mastering his emotions; but the old
soldier spirit in him was not yet dead, and he succeeded
in regaining control over his nerves.</p>

<p>“Bad news, Daughter, I’m sorry to say,” he
told her.</p>

<p>“Is it about your investment?” she asked, showing
that she had been entertaining fears in that direction
for some little time.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, that is it,” he said, as well as his
trembling lips could form the words. “This lawyer
tells me the company has been in difficulties
for some time, though they kept hoping to bridge
over their trouble. But something happened that
they had not counted on, and they went under with
a smash. He says they may be able to pay thirty
cents on the dollar, but it will take time even at
that to realize on their properties.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Horner, deeply moved, took the letter
from his unresisting hand, and looked it over. The
fatal news was written in a cold unfeeling fashion,
for lawyers could not be expected to sympathize<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
with unknown clients. The firm offered to act for
Mr. Horner in the matter for the ordinary fee,
to be paid when any money was recovered.</p>

<p>Dick and Leslie too could easily read all this.
The former was sadly dazed, and Leslie felt
shocked. The latter knew that the Horners had
had little enough to live upon for some years, and
if half of their meagre income were suddenly
snatched away in this cruel manner, it would mean
a serious matter.</p>

<p>It was wonderful, however, how quickly the old
man managed to recover from the blow. His one
thought was to shield those who were so dear to
him.</p>

<p>“Well,” they heard him say bravely, “I have
been taking my ease too long as it is, and tomorrow—no,
the day after Christmas, I mean to start
out and visit my friends to see if there is not some
employment I may obtain. I used to be a good
hand at figures, and could keep a set of books
fairly well. Don’t worry too much Polly, dear;
it will all come out right yet. You know they say
it is always darkest before dawn.”</p>

<p>Leslie winked a good many times even while
he smiled at the idea of that weak old gentleman,
who found it so difficult even to walk in the garden,
striking bravely out to try to find work.
There was a suspicious moisture in the boy’s eyes,
for he was deeply affected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>“That would be a nice thing, wouldn’t it, Grandpop!”
declared Dick stoutly; “for a husky fellow
like me to keep on going to school while you
worked in an office. I reckon it’s going to be me
who’ll get busy, and pay for my salt. I’ve been
thinking about just that sort of thing for some
time. It was bound to come, and this letter has
only hurried things along a little.”</p>

<p>Leslie felt it his duty to slap his chum on the
back when he heard this. No one knew better than
he what a sacrifice it would mean to Dick to quit
school; for the boy’s heart was set on securing a
good education, since he had planned a career for
himself that could never be attained unless he went
to college.</p>

<p>Uncle Silas had listened to all this talk in silence.
No one seemed to remember him at all just then,
one way or another. Even Leslie neglected to
watch him. Had he done so he might have seen
all sorts of emotions chasing each other across the
weather-beaten face of the wanderer.</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you how badly I feel to hear this
sad news, Sister Polly,” he now hastened to remark,
coming forward with a look of apparently
deep interest on his countenance. “It compels me
to say what I have been meaning to for some little
time. I must be going on my way. You have been
kindness itself to a poor old health-broken chap,
the rolling-stone that could gather no moss. Now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
it is time for me to relieve you of my presence,
which must not become a burden on your slender
resources.”</p>

<p>At that Mrs. Horner looked doubly distressed;
while grandpop shook his white head in the negative.</p>

<p>“Please don’t speak of leaving us just yet,
Brother,” said Dick’s mother. “All of us I am
sure would miss your cheery ways very much.
Father has seemed so happy with you for company,
and I began to believe he was getting
younger every day of your stay. And you said
you had no other home.”</p>

<p>“But my dear sister, every little counts now with
you, and I am unable to work any longer, much as
I should like to buckle to,” remonstrated Uncle
Silas, just as though he meant every word he
said.</p>

<p>“Oh! but what you eat does not matter much,”
she told him, affectionately, as she laid a loving
hand on the wanderer’s arm. “Stay with us a little
longer, Silas, and perhaps the skies will
brighten. I seem to have faith that the tide must
turn soon now; and we have been a happy family
together, you know.”</p>

<p>Uncle Silas was affected even to tears, and he
turned aside as though ashamed of giving way to
a weakness. Leslie saw this, but being of a skeptical
turn of mind, especially in connection with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
everything that concerned the wanderer, he rubbed
his chin in his odd way, and muttered to himself:</p>

<p>“His eyes looked watery, all right; but mebbe
after all they were crocodile tears. Some people
can make themselves cry even on the stage. But
I wonder what the old fellow’s game can be? One
thing sure, I bet you he doesn’t mean to skip out
of the comfy nest he’s struck after all his wanderings.”</p>

<p>Indeed, Uncle Silas was soon exerting himself
to raise the drooping spirits of the others, and
even began to joke in a way he had never done before.</p>

<p>“Why should we allow ourselves to mope, and
feel badly when tomorrow morning will be Christmas,”
he told them several times. “Something
may happen to make this old world look brighter
to our eyes. You know what you read in the lesson,
Grandpop—‘weeping may endure for a night, but
joy cometh in the morning.’ Let’s hope so, anyway.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVII<br>

<small>WHAT HAPPENED ON CHRISTMAS EVE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the evening set in Dick felt his gloomy fears
increase rather than diminish. It was strange, too,
because as a general thing the boy had always been
of a cheery disposition, and able to stand up under
all manner of ordinary troubles.</p>

<p>He was not thinking of himself at all. What
sacrifices the new plan he had in mind entailed did
not count in the least. It was mother, and dear
old grandpop, Dick was so anxious about. He
knew how in times past they had frequently been
forced to scrimp and save in order to enjoy a few
things they craved; and now it would be harder
than ever to make ends meet.</p>

<p>Still, Dick found that after supper had been
dispatched he was feeling in a better humor. Perhaps
the meal had something to do with this; then
again the fact that it was Christmas Eve was to
be considered, for after all Dick was a lad whose
spirits were buoyant.</p>

<p>Perhaps, too, the way in which Uncle Silas tried
to make them forget the new trouble may have had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
something to do with the change in his feelings.
Indeed, never had the wanderer shown himself in
such a happy mood. It seemed as though he must
be exerting himself to the utmost with the idea
of making the others forget.</p>

<p>The stories he told of his life in the frozen
North, where men hunted for the hidden gold
amidst glaciers and snowbanks, were full of rollicking
humor. He had dear old grandpop laughing
heartily at his comical descriptions; and Dick
confessed that having Uncle Silas there at such
a time of distress was as good as a tonic.</p>

<p>A knock at the door came about eight o’clock.
Dick went to see who was there. As a rule, he
would have expected to find one of his chums, or
a neighbor; but tonight he felt nervous, and half
anticipated discovering an unwelcome visitor in
the shape of some officer, who would tell them
their home was to be attached for debt.</p>

<p>“Good evening to ye, Dick,” said a voice. “Mr.
Nocker he says I am to give ye this same package,
which is from his daughter, and little Billy.”</p>

<p>“Oh! is it you, Pat?” remarked Dick, considerably
relieved. “All right, I’ll take it in; and be
sure to tell them all we send them a lot of thanks
for remembering us, and hope they’ll have a real
Merry Christmas.”</p>

<p>It was quite a package, and Dick laughed as he
placed it on the table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>“To think of them remembering the Horners
at Christmas,” he remarked, as she stared at the
package. “I guess after all it isn’t going to be such
a dull time for some of us. Shall I open it now,
Mother, or leave it till the morning?”</p>

<p>“Suit yourself, Son,” she told him. “Many people
give their gifts the night before Christmas;
and perhaps you’ll sleep better if you see what it
contains now.”</p>

<p>“Well, I believe I’ll just have to do it,” said
Dick, with which he soon whipped the heavy cord
off the package.</p>

<p>“Looks like a new suit of clothes for somebody!”
chuckled Uncle Silas.</p>

<p>Dick snatched up the coat, and examined it. A
small tag bore some writing, and he saw that it
was a pretty card decorated with red Christmas
flowers, and bearing a few words which he read
aloud:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>To Dick, from little Billy, wishing him
the happiest Christmas of his whole life!</i>”</p>
</div>

<p>“Oh! but ought I take such a thing from them,
when Mr. Nocker is the one who will have to pay
the bill?” said Dick, wonderingly.</p>

<p>“Why not?” demanded Uncle Silas, promptly.
“If he sent you a dozen such presents he could
never begin to pay back the debt he owes you.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
Didn’t you plan the scheme that gave him the
treasures he now has in his gloomy old mansion?
And only for your bravery and quick action might
he not have lost them both in that fire? Don’t
you hesitate for a minute, Dick, to accept this little
gift.”</p>

<p>“But here’s something more, and for you,
Mother!” exclaimed the boy, excitedly.</p>

<p>It proved to be a nice warm fleecy worsted shawl
for her shoulders. And a third package turned
out to be a delightful smoking jacket for the old
veteran, in which he would find great joy and comfort
as he sat by the open fire winter days.</p>

<p>All of them were delighted with their gifts.
Uncle Silas pretended to be quite disappointed because
he too had not been remembered.</p>

<p>“Seems like I’m the only one left out in the
cold,” he laughed, merrily. “But then I’m a newcomer
here, and haven’t any right to expect much.
Perhaps if I hung up my stocking tonight, like we
used to do when we were youngsters, Polly, old
Santa Claus might take a notion to slip just a <i>little</i>
remembrance in the same. Now, just for luck,
let’s all do it. It brings back happy days to even
speak of such a thing. And for once let’s forget
trouble as though we were children again.”</p>

<p>His sister smiled, a little sadly it must be confessed.</p>

<p>“If it will please you, Silas,” she told him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
“we will agree; though no one must expect much.
Our intentions are tremendous, but sad to say we
are hampered by conditions that tie our hands.
But even a little gift may carry worlds of love with
it.”</p>

<p>Dick had provided a small tree, and they all
sat up late decorating it. Even old grandpop insisted
on tying a few baubles to the branches, in
memory of the days when he used to do the same
for the children who were now gone.</p>

<p>Little Susie had of course been put to bed before
this, for the tree was mainly intended for her
delight; though the others found more or less
pleasure in its decoration.</p>

<p>And there were five stockings hung up alongside
the fireplace; Susie had insisted on fastening one
borrowed from her mother, since she naively remarked
that her own might be too small for what
the good fairies meant to bring her, and she would
not want to miss anything for lack of room.</p>

<p>After Dick went to his little room and retired,
he lay there a long time, utterly unable to lose himself
in sleep. The blow that had fallen that afternoon
had given him a shock, and try as he would
he could not get it out of his mind.</p>

<p>Lying there he could see through his open door
the flickering of the firelight in the living-room beyond,
where the little Christmas tree stood in all
its brave finery. When the blaze came up he could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
even count the five stockings hanging there, each
with something in it, for they had contrived to do
this before separating for the night.</p>

<p>Dick sighed many times. He somehow was
thinking of that golden prize which Mr. Holwell
had offered for the best farce, and which would
be awarded a few nights after Christmas. If only
he had won that there were so many things he
had planned to buy with the twenty-five dollars that
would have made the Great Day seem so much
more joyful.</p>

<p>Dick, lying there, suddenly became aware of
the fact that some one was moving in the other
room. He even half raised his head to look, and
when the fire picked up a little, discovered that it
was Uncle Silas.</p>

<p>“To be sure,” Dick told himself, “I remember
now that he didn’t think to put anything in the
stockings when we turned in, and he’s meaning to
do that now. But the poor old chap has mighty
little to spare. Still, half a dollar given in the
right spirit would mean as much as a thousand
times the same from a rich man.”</p>

<p>Dick felt enough curiosity to watch Uncle Silas.
He saw the wanderer fumbling with the different
stockings. He even had the assurance to pull out
what they contained and glance at the small offerings.
When Dick saw that he seemed to be moved
by some emotion, he himself felt a little annoyed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>“I hope now he isn’t laughing at what we’ve
given him,” he muttered half under his breath.
“He’s certainly as full of curiosity as a youngster
waking up in the moonlight, and creeping out of
bed to see what Santa has left for him; and that’s
what I did once myself. There, he’s satisfied now,
anyway, and is trotting off to his cot again.”</p>

<p>After that Dick again set himself the task of
trying to get to sleep, though he found it the hardest
kind of work. Even this latest strange action
on the part of Uncle Silas worried him. He remembered
all that Leslie had ever said about the
wanderer. Could it be possible that Uncle Silas
<i>was</i> an impostor; or that he had actually planned
to come and settle down on his poor sister, to be
taken care of for the balance of his natural life?</p>

<p>“Oh! shucks! forget all that stuff, can’t you?”
Dick scolded himself as he turned once more with
his back to the open door, so as to shut out the
flickering firelight. “Uncle Silas is all right, and
you know it. He’s only a little queer in the upper
story. You know he told how he was struck on
the head once by a falling rock, and nearly killed.
Now go to sleep, so you’ll feel fresh when morning
comes.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it must have been close on to midnight
when Dick finally managed to drop off.
What his dreams were no one ever knew, but at
least he did sleep until the sun was above the horizon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
on that bright Christmas morning, which was
something unusual for him, as he always attended
to the chores promptly in order to save the little
mother steps.</p>

<p>So Dick hastily dressed, his mind beginning to
fill once more with a confusion of anxieties and
hopes, as all that had taken place on the previous
afternoon and evening trooped through his active
brain.</p>

<p>“Tomorrow I’ll begin to look for a situation,”
he was saying as he finished his dressing. “Perhaps
better days will be coming along later on,
when I can complete my education. I can hear
mother in the kitchen; perhaps she may need something,
so I’ll find out.”</p>

<p>“Nothing to be done, Son,” Mrs. Horner announced,
after kissing him warmly, and returning
his greeting of a Merry Christmas. “But I hear
some one knocking at the front door, so go and answer,
for I think I saw Leslie pass the kitchen
window.”</p>

<small>UNCLE SILAS, THE WIZARD</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Hello</span>! there! Merry Christmas to you, Dick,
old chum!” exclaimed Leslie, as he pushed in
through the door as soon as it was opened.
“Here’s a little something I know you’ve been
wanting this long while.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my stars! a pair of dandy hockey skates!”
gasped the astonished Dick, as he tore the paper
from the package that had been thrust into his
hands. “You’ve just about knocked me silly, Leslie,
for a fact. And my present to you is such a
little one, too.”</p>

<p>“Little!” echoed the other, holding up the book
he had taken from its wrappings. “Why, I’ve been
meaning to get this for over half a year. And the
best of it is you earned every cent it cost, while I
had most of my money from my folks. It’s worth
ten times as much as what I paid for the skates,
every time, and don’t you forget it.”</p>

<p>“The finest skates I ever saw,” said Dick, joyously,
as he again examined his present. “I can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
see what bully times I’ll have this winter—that
is of nights, after I get home from work.”</p>

<p>“Oh! rats! don’t say that as if you meant it,
Dick. If you leave school I’ll never have the heart
to keep on to graduation time. You know how
we planned to stick together through thick and
thin. I’ll ask dad to let me start working, too,
see if I don’t.”</p>

<p>“That would be silly of you,” Dick told him.
“But let’s try to forget it all, for one more day.
Time enough to bother when tomorrow comes.”</p>

<p>“What’s this I see!” exclaimed Leslie, humorously.
“Five stockings hung up in a row; and
here’s little Susie beginning to look into hers, after
she’s done staring at the gay tree. What luck did
you have, Dick?”</p>

<p>“Oh! I hadn’t thought to look yet,” admitted
the other. “In fact, I overslept, and had just gone
into the kitchen to see if I could help mother with
breakfast when you knocked on the door.”</p>

<p>He stepped over to the mantel, gave the fire
some attention to start it to burning briskly again,
and was about to take hold of the stocking that
had been hung up for him when he stopped short.</p>

<p>Something was peeping above the one his
mother had hung up for herself, and into which
Dick had managed to cram the present he had
purchased for her. It looked like a formidable
document to Dick too, and somehow the sight of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
it gave him a cold shiver, as though he feared new
developments that might mean more trouble.</p>

<p>“I wonder what it is,” he muttered, uneasily;
and then overcome by curiosity, he reached forth
his hand, and boldly drew the document out.</p>

<p>Leslie too leaned forward as Dick gazed at the
paper which he now knew Uncle Silas must have
placed there after all the rest had retired.</p>

<p>“Oh, my stars!” ejaculated Leslie, shrilly.
“It’s a real Government bond, don’t you see, Dick,
with your mother’s full name on it, and for—why,
I must be dreaming—<i>ten thousand dollars</i>!”</p>

<p>Dick uttered a loud cry that seemed to come
from the depths of his overcharged heart. As if
the shout had been a signal to draw them, the little
mother came hurrying in from the kitchen, while
grandpop made his appearance, cane in hand, his
room being close at hand.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Dick?” questioned Mrs.
Horner, looking deeply interested.</p>

<p>“Leslie fetched you a present, did he?” demanded
the veteran as his eyes fell upon the glistening
hockey skates lying neglected now on the
table.</p>

<p>Dick could not say a word, but he thrust the
wonderful paper into the hands of his mother.
Her eyes drank in the printed form on the outside,
with her name plainly inscribed as the owner
of the bond.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>“What does it mean, Son?” she asked, weakly.
“I don’t seem able to understand.”</p>

<p>“Why, it’s a Christmas present for you, Mrs.
Horner, from Uncle Silas,” explained Leslie, only
too desirous of making immediate amends for all
his base suspicions of the past. “He’s waited his
time, and sprung the greatest surprise I ever heard
of on you all. Bully for Uncle Silas, I say; <i>he’s</i>
all right!”</p>

<p>“What’s this you’re saying about me?” asked
a voice, and the wanderer appeared in view, his
weather-beaten face wreathed in a broad smile of
happiness and contentment. “They say listeners
never hear any good of themselves. Tell me to
my face if you dare.”</p>

<p>Polly looked at him almost helplessly. Then
she raised the precious Government bond, with the
magic figures printed upon it.</p>

<p>“What—where—how—oh! Silas, how could
you deceive us so, and let us believe you poor and
homeless, when you were a rich man all the
while?”</p>

<p>Thereupon Uncle Silas gathered the little
woman into his arms, and, kissing her fondly, went
on to solve the mystery.</p>

<p>“Well,” he proceeded to explain, seeing that
they were all consumed with natural curiosity,
“after losing three fortunes through being too
greedy, I finally got hold of a claim that I sold for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
fifty thousand dollars cash. By that time I was in
fact broken in health, so I firmly determined to
hunt up any relatives I might have left, and if they
proved to be the right sort, stay with them the
balance of my life, leaving them all I had in return.”</p>

<p>“And you were playing a sly game on us all the
while, you rogue!” remarked the old veteran, as
he grasped the wanderer’s extended hand, and
squeezed it heartily.</p>

<p>“Can you blame me in one way?” demanded
Uncle Silas. “I wanted to be very sure that I was
being received for myself alone, and not because
I was worth that much money. Of course, I soon
learned that there were hearts of true gold under
this humble roof, and that I would never be allowed
to leave it. But it pleased me to persist in
my assumed role until this happy morning came.”</p>

<p>“And true enough, as you said, ‘weeping may
endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning!’”
cried Mrs. Horner, with her sisterly arms
about his neck. “Surely the clouds did not last
long, and the dawn seems all the more beautiful
because of that letter yesterday.”</p>

<p>“It’s the greatest Christmas that ever was!”
cried Dick, as he too hung on to the hand of Uncle
Silas. “How glad I am to know that after all I
needn’t give up my schooling yet.”</p>

<p>“You are a fine lad, and I’m proud to have you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
for my nephew,” said Uncle Silas, heartily.
“Please Heaven you shall go to college, and find
your true place in a world that needs just such fellows
as you. There will be no reason for any of
the dear ones under this roof to face want again,
for I have enough for all, and what is mine is
yours. You offered me a home when you believed
me poor and sick. I have proved your hearts by
deeds; after this we will find true happiness together
here.”</p>

<p>Dick could hardly eat a morsel of breakfast, he
was so excited. Several times he even asked
Leslie, who stayed to the meal with them, to pinch
him, for he felt he really must be dreaming, and
that on being aroused the amazing event would
prove to be only an illusion.</p>

<p>But the sight of that wonderful Government
bond on the mantel always gave him renewed hope
and strengthened his wavering faith.</p>

<p>“After all, I guess this has been a glorious day
for you, old fellow,” Leslie was saying, as he
donned his outer coat, and prepared to run over
home so as to carry the delightful news.</p>

<p>“I never saw the sky look so blue before in
all my life,” the other boy admitted. “And listen
to the church bells ringing, will you? It seems to
me they must know all that’s happened here, and
are singing just as my heart’s doing right now.
I’m the happiest fellow in Cliffwood; and I ought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
to get out so as to try to make some other chap
feel a little the same way by doing him a good
turn.”</p>

<p>“My mother will be just tickled half to death,”
asserted Leslie. “She’s been doing little save talk
about your trouble ever since I told her, trying to
figure out how she could help you all without offending
you. I just can’t stay any longer because
I want to tell her the big news. Hurrah for Uncle
Silas, say I! He’s turned out to be a regular
trump! And how he did fool me in the bargain!”</p>

<p>With that Leslie hurried away, only turning to
wave his hand at his chum, and shout out:</p>

<p>“Everything’s headed your way at last, Dick;
and I bet you five cents against a cookey that fine
farce of yours is bound to take the prize Mr. Holwell’s
offering. Nat may try all he wants, but he
can’t fight against such luck as has set in toward
the Horners. Mark my words, will you?”</p>

<p>Dick only laughed in reply as he closed the door,
and once more went in to make sure the amazing
paper still stood there on the mantel in the living
room. If he took it in his hands and examined
the precious document once that morning, he did a
dozen times; though finally Mrs. Horner thought
it best to place it securely away in a receptacle
where she kept the few little valuables she possessed.</p>

<p>Toward the middle of the morning, Dick, remembering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
his new hockey skates, managed to tear
himself away from the little house where so much
happiness was concentrated, and go forth to seek
the big pond, with the intention of testing the steel
runners.</p>

<p>And during that day the boy sought and found
some fellow who had been utterly forgotten by the
patron saint of Christmas, upon whom he bestowed
his other skates, as well as something in the shape
of money. Dick’s heart was overflowing with
gratitude for the amazing good fortune that had
come to his home; and this, according to his mind,
was the only way in which he could pass the good
cheer along.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIX<br>

<small>THE END OF THE STRUGGLE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> time had finally come when the committee
appointed to judge the several farces entered in
the competition for the prize, met to complete their
part of the proceedings.</p>

<p>Every fellow who belonged to the Boys’ Department
of the prosperous Y. M. C. A., as well as
many of the girls, were on the tiptoe of excitement.
While the vast majority of them firmly believed
that Dick was sure to be the successful candidate
for honors, there were others who seemed confident
that Nat would come in a winner.</p>

<p>“I understand,” said Elmer Jones, as the boys
began to gather that evening in the hall, where the
choice was to be duly announced, “that the committee
is now in session in another part of the
building, and having the best of the farces read
aloud by Mr. Parkhurst, who once upon a time
used to be a public reader.”</p>

<p>“Sure thing,” added Peg Fosdick. “And I’ll
tell you a little secret in the bargain. Never mind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
how I came to know it, but you can depend on it
for a fact.”</p>

<p>“Pitch right in then, Peg!” urged one of those
clustered around the two.</p>

<p>“It takes Peg to get on the track of things,”
laughed another.</p>

<p>“Listen then,” Peg went on softly, in his mysterious
way. “While Mr. Holwell, you understand,
isn’t on the committee, he has been asked
to join them. I saw him going through just a little
while back.”</p>

<p>“Whew! I wonder what that can mean?” remarked
Phil Harkness.</p>

<p>“Mebbe there’s some sort of hitch, and they
need an umpire to decide it,” suggested Clint Babbett.</p>

<p>“Either that,” went on Peg, with a wink, first
at Dick, and then toward Nat, both of whom were
in the bunch, “or else it’s a neck and neck race between
a couple of well-known junior residents of
Cliffwood, and they’re looking for some reason to
penalize one of the contestants.”</p>

<p>“You’re all wrong,” spoke up Andy Hale. “Listen
to me. Remember that little anecdote about
the sailor and the soldier. Some one wanted to
know which could give the time of day best. One
fellow said the soldier ought to, because he so
often had to mark time. But the answer was that
the sailor must be best qualified to tell, for the simple<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
reason that he had <i>been to sea</i>. Well, I’m the
Jack Tar, and I’ve been on the job.”</p>

<p>“Then why was Mr. Holwell called into the
room with the committee?” demanded Nat, boldly;
and those who were close to him could see that
he looked plainly concerned, as though the suspense
might be wearing heavily on him; while, on
the other hand, Dick seemed utterly unconcerned,
for the money part of the prize no longer appealed
to him as before his recent good fortune.</p>

<p>“Why, it seems that the committee have decided
on what they believe to be the greatest farce
of the lot, as well as the one that’s second best.
To make sure of their ground, they thought it
only right Mr. Howell should hear the prize effort.
Seems that it must be a stunner, that’s nearly
taken their breath away.”</p>

<p>At that Nat chuckled, and threw out his chest.</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t believe me, you fellows,” he remarked,
loftily; “but just wait and see. I reckon
you’ll change your minds some before long.”</p>

<p>“Yep,” added Dit Hennesy, boastfully, “nobody
suspected that there was a budding genius alivin’
here right in old Cliffwood. You’ll all admit, after
you hear his dandy farce read, that Nat’s got the
goods. All the rest’ll have to take his dust when
he travels along the road.”</p>

<p>“Look! there’s Mr. Holwell going out again!”
exclaimed Elmer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>“And he’s mighty serious looking too, make a
note of it!” added Peg.</p>

<p>“I wonder what’s up?” remarked Andy. “They
must have bumped up against a snag of some
kind.”</p>

<p>Leslie chanced to be looking toward Nat just
when Andy said this, and he saw the other give a
big start. His face went several degrees whiter
too, which was rather a singular thing in the case
of an expectant winner.</p>

<p>“Gee! I wonder now, is Nat up to any of his
old tricks?” was the thought that flashed through
the brain of Leslie as he noticed this.</p>

<p>Nat must have taken a firm grip of himself, for
the pallor quickly gave way to his customary ruddy
hue. He watched the door until the minister again
came into the building. Mr. Holwell was carrying
something in his hand which he had evidently
gone to his home to get.</p>

<p>“Looks like it might be a roll of manuscript,
too,” suggested Peg, humorously. “Wouldn’t it
be queer if Mr. Holwell had entered as a contestant
for his own prize?”</p>

<p>“You’re away off in your guess,” ventured Clint
Babbett; “for when he passed us I could plainly see
that it was a printed paper booklet, and one that
looked as if it might be an old relic of his minstrel
days!”</p>

<p>Nat shrank back, and said nothing; but when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
Leslie glanced curiously that way, he discovered
that once more the color had fled from the cheeks
of the boaster.</p>

<p>“Ginger!” muttered Leslie to himself, “I wonder
what ails Nat anyway? He’s acting just as if
he was in mortal fear of something jumping at
him.”</p>

<p>Minutes passed, and more people continued to
arrive, the big room beginning to fill up, for a great
deal of interest was being taken in the awarding
of the prize. So much had been said from time to
time about the keen competition, that the excitement
among the boys and girls was at white heat.</p>

<p>Even Mr. Loft, the librarian, whose superior
airs had so offended the boys of the town, had
condescended to grace the affair with his presence,
though never before had he been known to attend
a meeting like this.</p>

<p>“I’m beginning to have some hopes that in time
Mr. Loft will grow to be really human,” Leslie
was saying to his mates, when he spied the cultured
librarian in a seat not far away. “He’s finding
out that to know and understand boys he’s just
got to mingle with them.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Holwell does that,” observed another boy,
“and that is why all of us are ready to do anything
he asks us. We know that he’s always thinking
of helping a fellow who’s backward, or in
trouble.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>“Here comes Harry Bartlett straight this way!”
exclaimed Peg.</p>

<p>“Isn’t he one of the three committeemen who
were appointed to judge the farces?” demanded a
boy.</p>

<p>“Of course he is,” replied Peg. “And since
they’ve run up against a snag p’raps he’s after
Dick here to ask a question or so.”</p>

<p>Dick laughed in a free and easy manner. Indeed,
he would have been only too willing to answer
a score of questions just then, for his mind
was perfectly free from all sources of anxiety.</p>

<p>“You are wanted in the committee room, Nat!”
said Harry Bartlett, shortly.</p>

<p>“Who—me? What for?” asked Nat, in a
trembling voice.</p>

<p>“Never mind until you get there,” replied the
other sharply. “I was asked to bring you back
with me; that’s all I can say,” with which words
the leader of the Y. M. C. A. turned and retraced
his steps.</p>

<p>Nat tried to grin, for he knew that every eye
just then was fastened on him. But the attempt
was not much of a success. He arose to his feet
and shuffled after the messenger of the committee.
The rest of the boys gaped as they saw the door
of the committee room close on him.</p>

<p>“Whew! I wonder what’s doing?” ventured
Clint.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>“Ten to one Nat’s been up to some crooked
work again,” said Peg.</p>

<p>“You’d like to believe so, wouldn’t you?” sneered
Dit Hennesy, who, however, had a half alarmed
look on his sallow face. “Chances are the committee
want to congratulate Nat privately on his
genius before they make the public announcement.”</p>

<p>“Sure!” jeered Peg. “And Nat must have believed
that too, even if he did look like a criminal
being led to the execution block when he left us
just now. Watch and see what happens.”</p>

<p>Ten minutes passed away. Then the door
opened again, and Nat came out. He was holding
his head up, and grinning, but they could see what
an effort it cost him to put on such a bold, reckless
face.</p>

<p>To the astonishment of the boys, and the dismay
of Dit, Nat, instead of rejoining them, waved his
hand derisively, and quitted the building.</p>

<p>“Say, something must have busted in there!”
exclaimed Peg, excitedly.</p>

<p>“Huh! looks like the jig was up,” grunted Dit;
and presently he, too, was among the missing.</p>

<p>“There come the committee and they’re headed
for the stage!” said Clint. “Now the suspense
will soon be over, for Harry Bartlett is going to
announce the finding of the judges.”</p>

<p>The crowded room became as still as death<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
when the leader of the Y. M. C. A. commenced
to speak in his ready fashion.</p>

<p>“My friends, I am about to announce the verdict
of the committee appointed to serve as judges
in this contest arranged by Mr. Holwell. We did
our duty faithfully, and every farce submitted was
read carefully by all of us. Then on taking a vote
it was found that all must be eliminated save two,
both of which evinced positive merit.</p>

<p>“A second vote disclosed the fact that the majority
of the committee believed one of these to
have more merit than the other, though the names
of the contestants were unknown to us at the time.
In order that we should do no boy an injustice it
was decided to invite Mr. Holwell, whose ability
in that line you all know, to come in to hear these
two farces read by Mr. Parkhurst.</p>

<p>“When Mr. Holwell heard the leading farce
read, he looked serious, and asked that the one
that stood second choice should also be given.
Then he requested us to wait while he went home
and rooted through an old trunk where he kept
some mementoes of the old days when he once took
part in a minstrel show, before he thought of
studying for the ministry.</p>

<p>“When he came back he brought with him a
printed farce, published many years ago, and in
which he remembered once acting. No sooner
had he commenced reading this than we realized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
that the one we had selected as the winner had
been copied almost word for word from the
printed playlet.</p>

<p>“The pretended author was called in, and when
accused, readily admitted practicing the deceit,
though he stoutly claimed it was only done for a
joke, and that he would not have accepted the
money prize. He has been reprimanded, and has
departed with his stolen effort. I need hardly tell
you his name, for most of you can already guess it.</p>

<p>“Of course, after that there was no difficulty in
deciding on the farce that was plainly entitled to
the prize; and I have great pleasure in announcing
to you that the twenty-five dollars in gold, together
with the congratulations of the judges, go to Richard
Horner for his original black-face farce entitled
<i>When Erastus Came Home</i>, which I trust
all of you will have the pleasure of hearing in the
town hall two weeks from tonight. I thank you.”</p>

<p>His last words were drowned in a roar of cheers
that went up from the boys. Those who could
reach Dick shook his hands unmercifully; others
slapped him on the back, as they showered congratulations
on him.</p>

<small>CONCLUSION</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the two weeks had elapsed, the town
hall was crowded to its utmost capacity with one
of the finest audiences that had ever been seen in
Cliffwood. Of course, Uncle Silas, Grandpop
Horner, Dick’s mother and little sister Susie
were present to see how the boys who participated
in the minstrels carried out their various parts, and
Mr. Nocker also came, accompanied by his daughter-in-law.</p>

<p>The Y. M. C. A. boys had rehearsed faithfully,
under the supervision of Mr. Holwell, who
must have had a revival of his old-time interest
when he coached the amateur performers.</p>

<p>Dick was one of the end-men, and Peg played
the part of his rival at the other extremity of the
line. If the jokes which ran through the first part
of the entertainment caused considerable hilarity
in the audience some of the credit was due to the
ability shown by these two performers.</p>

ENTERTAINMENT.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Then followed other features of the show, and
in one of these Dick was enabled to display his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
really wonderful powers as an amateur ventriloquist,
playing the banjo during the same turn
quite cleverly.</p>

<p>The much-talked-of farce wound up the evening’s
entertainment, and every one agreed that it
was about as humorous a sketch as they had ever
heard or read. Even Nat was to be seen in the
audience, his customary grin adorning his bold
face; and it was quite evident that he had come
out to hear what sort of thing Dick had originated
to compete against his own stolen effort.</p>

<p>In the commencement of the evening Harry
Bartlett had made an announcement to the effect
that the entertainment was to be repeated for two
successive nights.</p>

<p>“The receipts are to be devoted to several purposes
connected with this new branch of the Y. M.
C. A.,” he went on to state; “one of which I am
pleased to say will be the extending of the Boys’
Library, which already contains over one hundred
volumes of books written by such authors as the
boys love. All of these books have been approved
by a capable censor, Mr. Holwell, who knows what
a boy should read better than any other person in
Cliffwood.”</p>

<p>As Harry made this broad statement there was
a sudden whirlwind of applause for a full minute
that must have cheered the heart of the minister;
nor would the boys stop clapping their hands until<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
from his corner, where he had hoped to remain
unobserved, Mr. Holwell was forced to stand up,
and, waving his hand, smilingly say:</p>

<p>“Thank you all, a thousand times. I would
rather be reckoned a true friend of the boys of
Cliffwood than to conquer a kingdom. And to
the older persons present, some of whom may
have entertained doubts about the success of our
latest movement to interest our lads in clean sports
and indoor entertainments, I wish to say, watch
the streets these nights, and compare things with
what they were six months ago. That is all.”</p>

<p>When the farce had finally come to an end
amidst uproarious laughter, there was no disposition
on the part of the audience to disperse immediately.</p>

<p>“They want you, Dick!” said Leslie, behind the
curtain.</p>

<p>“Listen to ’em calling your name!” added Peg,
delightedly. “The fellows are shouting it in concert,
just as they do the school yell at the football
games.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got to step out before the curtain and
say a few words, or they’ll pull the house down,”
Elmer told the laughing and excited author of the
piece.</p>

<p>“I’d rather take a licking, but I suppose I’ll
just have to do it,” Dick went on to say, with a
shrug of his shoulders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>When, black face and all, Dick made his appearance
before the curtain, there was a tumultuous
shout, after which all became quiet, as they
listened for what he would say. Fortunately, Dick
was not so bashful that he lost command of his
tongue. Besides, he could see that little mother
sitting there so proudly watching him; yes, and
closer up there was Connie Swazy too, with her
eyes sparkling and her little hands clapping vigorously.</p>

<p>“Ladies and gentlemen,” began Dick, bravely,
“it is very kind of you to give a poor struggling
author so much encouragement in his first effort.
I did the best I could, and I hope you got your
money’s worth from the entertainment as a whole.
We mean to try to do a heap better tomorrow
night, so ask your friends to attend, if one dose is
all you can stand.”</p>

<p>“Hear! hear!” cried a crowd of the boys seated
close to the stage.</p>

<p>“And there’s just one thing more,” continued
Dick, casting a roguish look in the direction of
Connie, who instantly shook her finger, at the
same time turning rosy red. “I noticed that you
seemed to enjoy the original airs to which my poor
songs were sung. They were composed by Miss
Connie Swazy, and I believe will be whistled by
every boy in Cliffwood for a long time to come.
That’s all I’ve got to say. Thank you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>Everybody voted the affair a huge success. If
the other two nights did as well there would be
a substantial sum put in the bank for the Junior
Department of the local Y. M. C. A., which would
purchase much needed equipment in the gymnasium,
as well as many new books quoted on the fall
lists of city publishers.</p>

<p>As was to be expected there was an influx of
new members at once, and Mr. Holwell realized
that he had made no mistake in getting up the entertainment
with the object of arousing fresh interest
in the work he was doing.</p>

<p>“And the best part of it all is,” remarked Dick,
as he and several others talked over matters one
afternoon when on the way home from school,
“we’re going to have a glorious time week after
week from now on, what with the lectures, the
gymnasium nights, the regular meetings, and all
the fun that’s in store for us.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” added Leslie, “Mr. Holwell never knows
when to stop once he gets started doing things for
boys. My Uncle Henry is interesting old Mr.
Nocker in some new scheme right now. They
won’t give me a hint of what it is; but I’ve got a
suspicion it has to do with a grand big outing for
next summer. Why, the old deacon is a different
man nowadays from what he used to be! That
coming of little Billy put new life in him, let me
tell you!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>“No matter what they’re planning ahead for
us,” said Dick, “one thing we know, and that is the
biggest event that ever happened for the boys of
Cliffwood came out of that fierce Hallowe’en joke
of Nat Silmore’s. Mr. Holwell says it was the
stepping stone that led to his thinking up the Junior
League of the Y. M. C. A.”</p>

<p>“I only wish every town had a man like Mr.
Holwell in it, who knew boys from the ground
up,” ventured Peg Fosdick, vehemently. “And all
the same I’d give something to learn what sort of
good time they’re fixing up for us.”</p>

<p>Perhaps Peg would have had his curiosity satisfied
had he been able to read the title of the next
story in this series, which will be, “The Y. M. C.
A. Boys on Bass Island; or The Mystery of Russabaga
Camp.” In that volume we shall see how
Jed Nocker came to the front in a most unexpected
manner; and what his offer to the Y. M. C. A.
boys led to.</p>

<p>Dick was very happy when he looked at the five
shining five-dollar gold pieces which the committee
had handed over to him.</p>

<p>“Now I’ve got my own new suit of clothes,” he
said to Leslie, “I am going to buy something for
mother and little Susie. And five dollars is going
to the good of every boy in the Y. M. C. A.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that, Dick?” his chum
asked him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>“I am going to buy books with it for our Library—cracking
good stories that all the boys will
like.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah! Dick, that will be fine!”</p>

<p>And here, for the time being, let us bid farewell
to the Y. M. C. A. Boys of Cliffwood.</p>

<p>This new series relates the doings of a

Christianity. Clean, elevating and
full of fun and vigor, books that should

<p class="center"><i>or The Struggle for the Holwell Prize</i></p>

<p>Telling how the boys of Cliffwood were a wild set and how,
on Hallowe’en, they turned the home town topsy-turvy. This
led to an organization of a boys’ department in the local
Y. M. C. A. When the lads realized what was being done for
them, they joined in the movement with vigor and did all they
could to help the good cause. To raise funds they gave a minstrel
show and other entertainments, and a number of them
did their best to win a gold medal offered by a local minister
who was greatly interested in the work of upbuilding youthful
character.</p>

<p class="ph1"><span class="smcap">The Y. M. C. A. Boys on Bass Island</span></p>
<p class="center"><i>or The Mystery of Russabaga Camp</i></p>

<p>Summer was at hand, and at a meeting of the boys of the
Y. M. C. A. of Cliffwood, it was decided that a regular summer
camp should be instituted. This was located at a beautiful
spot on Bass Island, and there the lads went boating, swimming,
fishing and tramping to their heart’s content. There
were a great many surprises, but in the end the boys managed
to clear up a mystery of long standing. Incidentally, the volume
gives a clear insight into the workings of the now justly
popular summer camps of the Y. M. C. A., throughout the
United States.</p>

<p class="ph1">By RAYMOND SPERRY, Jr.</p>

<p class="center">12mo. Cloth. Illustrated. Price per volume, 60 cents, postpaid.</p>

<p>This new series deals with the great
modern movement for temperance. Clean-cut,
up-to-date stories that will please all
growing boys and girls and do them a
world of good.</p>

<p class="ph1"><span class="smcap">The White Ribbon Boys of Chester</span></p>
<p class="center"><i>or The Old Tavern Keeper’s Secret</i></p>

<p>Chester was a typical factory town with its quota of drinking
places. The father of one of the boys was a foreman in
one of the factories, and he advocated temperance so strongly
that some of the men, urged on by an old tavern keeper,
plotted so that he lost his position. One day, when partly
intoxicated, the tavern keeper’s son climbs in a factory window,
smashes things, and is badly burned by acid. He is
rescued by the boys who are advocating temperance, who
take him to his mother. When the tavern keeper sees the
condition of his son, he breaks down, and confesses to the plot
against the discharged foreman. Temperance wins out, and
the town of Chester becomes far more prosperous than ever
before.</p>

<p class="ph1">
<span class="smcap">The White Ribbon Boys at Long Shore</span></p>
<p class="center"><i>or To the Rescue of Dan Bates</i><br>
</p>

<p>In this tale the scene is shifted to the seashore, where the
boys are having a vacation for the summer. Encouraged by
the temperance work done in their home town, they join a
local crusade to close the various drinking and gambling
houses. They fall in with another lad, the son of a well-known
drunkard of the summer resort, and do all they can to
aid him. A good, clean-cut boys’ story, full of life and action,
not at all preachy, but teaching the best of morals.</p>

conclude that the Motor Boys will try to run everything to suit
themselves.</p>

<p>A plot is formed to keep our heroes entirely in the background
and not let them participate in athletics and other contests.
How the Motor Boys forged to the front and made warm
friends of their rivals makes unusually interesting reading.</p>

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
